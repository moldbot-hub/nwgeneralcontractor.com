I specialize in:
- Kitchen remodeling
- Bathroom renovations
- ADU construction (garage conversions, backyard cottages)
- Home additions and room additions
- Deck building and outdoor living

Thinking about building an ADU in Snohomish County? 🏡

Washington State recently loosened regulations making it easier than ever to add an Accessory Dwelling Unit to your property. Whether it's a garage conversion, backyard cottage, or basement apartment, an ADU can:

• Generate $1,500-$2,500+/month in rental income
• Provide a home for aging parents or adult children
• Increase your property value by 20-30%

NW General Contractor handles the entire process — from permits to final inspection.
