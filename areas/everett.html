                    <h2>Everett's Trusted Home Remodeling Contractor</h2>
                    <p>As the largest city in Snohomish County with a population of over 110,000 residents, Everett is a city defined by its rich industrial history, stunning waterfront, and remarkably diverse housing stock. NW General Contractor is proud to call Everett home, and we bring decades of local construction expertise to every project we undertake in the city. From the historic craftsman bungalows of Port Gardner to the modern developments near Silver Lake, we understand the unique characteristics and challenges of Everett homes at every age and price point.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding Everett's Diverse Neighborhoods</h3>
                    <p>Everett's neighborhoods each carry a distinct character that influences remodeling priorities. In the <strong>Bayside</strong> and <strong>Port Gardner</strong> neighborhoods near the waterfront, you will find many of the city's oldest homes, some dating back to the early 1900s. These craftsman-style and Victorian-era residences often feature original woodwork, built-in cabinetry, and layouts that reflect a different era of living. Homeowners here frequently seek kitchen remodels that honor the home's historic charm while introducing modern amenities, along with bathroom renovations that replace aging plumbing and fixtures.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Delta</strong> and <strong>Riverside</strong> neighborhoods, situated along the Snohomish River, feature a mix of mid-century ranches and split-levels built during Everett's postwar boom. These homes typically have smaller kitchens, single bathrooms, and dated electrical systems. We regularly help Delta and Riverside homeowners with <a href="../services/kitchen-remodeling.html">kitchen remodeling</a> projects that open up closed floor plans, as well as <a href="../services/home-additions.html">home additions</a> that add much-needed living space for growing families.</p>

                    <p>Over in <strong>Lowell</strong>, one of Everett's most established working-class neighborhoods, the housing stock includes modest bungalows and cottages from the 1930s through 1960s. Many of these homes are seeing renewed interest as first-time buyers move in and invest in comprehensive updates. Our <a href="../services/whole-home-renovation.html">whole-home renovation</a> services are especially popular in Lowell, where homeowners want to modernize aging infrastructure while maintaining the neighborhood's approachable character.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Pinehurst</strong> and <strong>Boulevard Bluffs</strong> areas sit at higher elevations and offer some of the most desirable views in the city. Homes here tend to be larger, built from the 1970s through the 1990s, and are now reaching the age where major systems need replacement. We see strong demand for <a href="../services/deck-building.html">deck building</a> and outdoor living spaces in these neighborhoods, where homeowners want to take full advantage of their territorial and mountain views.</p>

                    <p>Further out, the <strong>Silver Lake</strong> and <strong>Westmont</strong> areas feature newer suburban development from the 1990s and 2000s. While these homes are structurally sound, many homeowners are upgrading builder-grade finishes with custom kitchens, spa-quality bathrooms, and <a href="../services/custom-carpentry.html">custom carpentry</a> details that personalize their spaces.</p>

                    <h3>Common Remodeling Needs in Everett</h3>
                    <p>Everett's housing history creates predictable remodeling patterns. A significant portion of the city's housing stock was built before 1978, which means lead paint and asbestos are common concerns during renovation. Our team is trained in safe abatement practices and works with certified testing laboratories to ensure every project meets current safety standards.</p>

                    <p>The Boeing Everett Factory and Naval Station Everett bring a steady flow of workers and military families to the area, many of whom purchase older homes and invest in updates. We frequently work with these homeowners on projects ranging from straightforward <a href="../services/bathroom-remodeling.html">bathroom remodels</a> to full-scale renovations that transform dated properties into modern, comfortable homes.</p>

                    <p>With the City of Everett actively encouraging accessory dwelling units to address the region's housing shortage, <a href="../services/adu-construction.html">ADU construction</a> has become one of our fastest-growing services. Whether you are building a detached backyard cottage or converting a garage into a rental unit, we handle every phase from design and permitting through final inspection. Everett's ADU regulations allow units up to 800 square feet on most single-family lots, and we have completed numerous ADU projects across the city.</p>

                    <h3>Local Permits and Regulations</h3>
                    <p>Everett's Community Development Department oversees building permits for residential construction. As a licensed contractor with deep experience navigating Everett's permitting process, we manage all permit applications, plan reviews, and inspections on behalf of our clients. Projects in the Port Gardner Historic District may require additional design review to ensure renovations complement the neighborhood's architectural heritage. We are well-versed in these requirements and can guide homeowners through the approval process efficiently.</p>

                    <h3>Why Everett Homeowners Choose NW General Contractor</h3>
                    <p>Being based in Everett means we are never far from your project. We know the local building inspectors, we understand the soil conditions that affect foundations across the city, and we have established relationships with material suppliers who serve the Snohomish County market. Our commitment to quality craftsmanship and transparent communication has made us a trusted name in Everett home improvement. Whether you are updating a century-old craftsman in the Port Gardner neighborhood or adding an ADU to your Silver Lake property, NW General Contractor delivers results that last.</p>
