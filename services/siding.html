        <h2>Professional Siding That Stands Up to Pacific Northwest Weather</h2>
        <p>Your siding does more than define how your home looks from the street. It is the primary barrier between your walls and the relentless moisture that defines the Puget Sound climate. Rain, wind, humidity, and temperature swings put constant stress on exterior cladding, and when siding fails, the damage spreads quickly to sheathing, framing, and insulation. Replacing worn or damaged siding is one of the smartest investments you can make for the long-term health of your home.</p>
        <p>At NW General Contractor, we install and repair siding throughout Everett and Snohomish County. We work with fiber cement, vinyl, engineered wood, and natural wood siding, and we handle every step from removing the old material to installing a proper moisture barrier to finishing the trim and caulk. We are licensed, bonded, and insured in Washington state, and we build every exterior to handle the conditions we actually live in.</p>

        <h2>Our Siding Services</h2>
        <p>Every home exterior is different. Some need a full re-siding. Others need targeted repairs or an upgrade in material. We assess the actual condition of your exterior and recommend a scope of work that addresses both the immediate problems and the long-term performance of your home. Here is what we handle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Siding Installation</strong> &mdash; Complete removal of existing siding followed by inspection of the sheathing, installation of house wrap and flashing, and new siding applied according to manufacturer specifications. We install all major siding types and handle multi-story homes.</li>
          <li><strong>Siding Repair</strong> &mdash; Targeted replacement of cracked, warped, rotted, or storm-damaged siding sections. We match existing profiles and colors whenever possible to maintain a consistent appearance without replacing the entire exterior.</li>
          <li><strong>HardiePlank &amp; Fiber Cement Siding</strong> &mdash; James Hardie fiber cement is the most popular siding material in the Pacific Northwest. We are experienced installers of HardiePlank lap siding, HardieShingle, and HardiePanel vertical siding in both primed and ColorPlus pre-finished options.</li>
          <li><strong>Vinyl Siding</strong> &mdash; A cost-effective option that offers low maintenance and a wide range of colors and profiles. Modern vinyl siding is fade-resistant, impact-resistant, and does not require painting. We install insulated and non-insulated vinyl systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Wood Siding</strong> &mdash; Cedar, pine, and other natural wood sidings for homeowners who want a classic or rustic look. We handle beveled lap, board-and-batten, tongue-and-groove, and shingle-style installations. Wood siding requires more maintenance in the Pacific Northwest but delivers unmatched character.</li>
          <li><strong>LP SmartSide</strong> &mdash; Engineered wood siding treated with SmartGuard process for moisture and termite resistance. LP SmartSide offers the look and workability of natural wood with improved durability. Available in lap, panel, and trim profiles.</li>
          <li><strong>Trim &amp; Fascia</strong> &mdash; Replacement of rotted or damaged trim boards, fascia, and soffits. We use PVC, fiber cement, and primed wood trim depending on the application and the homeowner's preference. Proper trim work is essential for sealing the building envelope.</li>
          <li><strong>House Wrap &amp; Moisture Barrier</strong> &mdash; Installation of Tyvek, Henry Blueskin, or similar weather-resistive barriers behind new siding. Proper house wrap installation with sealed seams and integrated flashing at windows and doors is the most critical step in preventing moisture intrusion in the Pacific Northwest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Siding Materials: Choosing the Right Protection for Your Home</h2>
        <p>The material you choose for your siding affects everything from maintenance frequency to energy efficiency to the long-term durability of your home's exterior. In western Washington, moisture resistance is the most important factor in material selection.</p>
        <p><strong>Fiber cement (HardiePlank)</strong> is the most popular siding choice in Snohomish County, and for good reason. Made from a blend of cement, sand, and cellulose fibers, it is dimensionally stable, rot-resistant, fire-resistant, and impervious to insects. HardiePlank holds paint far longer than wood &mdash; typically 15 to 20 years between repaints &mdash; and it does not warp, crack, or swell from moisture exposure. James Hardie offers a ColorPlus pre-finished option that carries a 15-year color warranty. Fiber cement is heavier than other siding materials and requires experienced installation, but it delivers the best overall performance for Pacific Northwest conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Vinyl siding</strong> is the most affordable option and requires the least ongoing maintenance. Modern vinyl does not need painting, resists fading, and cleans easily with a garden hose. Insulated vinyl siding adds a layer of rigid foam backing that improves energy efficiency and reduces noise. Vinyl is a strong choice for homeowners who want a clean, fresh exterior without the maintenance commitment of painted materials. It is not as impact-resistant as fiber cement, and cheaper grades can look flat, but quality vinyl from manufacturers like CertainTeed and Ply Gem delivers good results for the price.</p>
        <p><strong>LP SmartSide</strong> is an engineered wood product that gives you the look and feel of real wood with significantly better moisture and pest resistance. The SmartGuard manufacturing process uses zinc borate to protect against fungal decay and termites. LP SmartSide is lighter than fiber cement, easier to cut and install, and available in a full range of profiles including lap, panel, shingle, and trim. It needs repainting every 10 to 15 years, which is more frequent than fiber cement but less than natural wood.</p>

        <h2>What Does New Siding Cost in Everett?</h2>
        <p>Siding costs depend on the material, the size of your home, the number of stories, and the complexity of the exterior (windows, corners, trim details). Here are the general ranges we see for full re-siding projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vinyl siding</strong> ($6,000 &ndash; $12,000): Full re-siding of an average-sized home with quality vinyl, including house wrap, trim, and cleanup. Insulated vinyl runs toward the higher end of this range.</li>
          <li><strong>Fiber cement siding</strong> ($12,000 &ndash; $25,000): HardiePlank or equivalent fiber cement installation including house wrap, flashing, trim, caulking, and painting (if using primed rather than pre-finished product).</li>
          <li><strong>Premium wood siding</strong> ($20,000 &ndash; $35,000+): Natural cedar or other wood siding with full house wrap, priming, painting or staining, and custom trim work. The higher cost reflects both the material price and the more labor-intensive installation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>New siding consistently ranks among the highest-return exterior improvements. The Cost vs. Value Report shows fiber cement siding replacement recouping approximately 82% of the cost at resale. Beyond the financial return, new siding eliminates moisture problems that lead to rot, mold, and structural damage &mdash; issues that are particularly costly to repair in the wet Pacific Northwest climate.</p>

        <h2>Our Siding Installation Process</h2>
        <p>Proper siding installation is about much more than nailing boards to the wall. The moisture management system behind the siding is what actually protects your home. Here is our process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Inspection &amp; Assessment</strong> &mdash; We inspect your existing siding, sheathing, trim, and moisture barriers. We identify rot, mold, insect damage, and areas where water has been getting behind the cladding. You receive a written assessment with photos and our recommendations.</li>
          <li><strong>Detailed Quote &amp; Material Selection</strong> &mdash; We provide a written estimate that covers removal, disposal, materials, labor, and any necessary sheathing repairs. We help you select the right siding material, color, and profile for your home and budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Remove Old Siding</strong> &mdash; Existing siding is carefully removed and disposed of. We inspect all sheathing for damage, soft spots, and rot. Any compromised sheathing is replaced before moving forward.</li>
          <li><strong>Install House Wrap &amp; Flashing</strong> &mdash; We install a weather-resistive barrier (house wrap) with properly lapped seams, sealed with manufacturer-approved tape. Window and door openings receive integrated flashing to direct water away from the framing. This step is the most important part of the entire installation.</li>
          <li><strong>Install Siding</strong> &mdash; Siding is installed according to manufacturer specifications, with proper nailing patterns, clearances, and expansion gaps. Corners, transitions, and penetrations receive appropriate trim and sealant.</li>
          <li><strong>Trim, Caulk &amp; Finish</strong> &mdash; All trim boards, corner pieces, and J-channel are installed. Joints are caulked with high-quality exterior sealant. If the siding is primed (not pre-finished), we apply two coats of premium exterior paint.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Inspection &amp; Cleanup</strong> &mdash; We walk the completed exterior with you, address any punch-list items, and make sure every detail meets our standards. Job site is cleaned, debris is hauled away, and landscaping is restored.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does a Siding Project Take?</h2>
        <p>Siding timelines depend on the size of your home, the number of stories, the material being installed, and the extent of any underlying repairs. Here is what to expect for typical projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small repairs or partial siding replacement: 1&ndash;3 days</li>
          <li>Single-story home, full re-siding: 1&ndash;2 weeks</li>
          <li>Two-story home, full re-siding: 2&ndash;3 weeks</li>
          <li>Large or complex home with extensive trim: 3&ndash;4 weeks</li>
          <li>Add 3&ndash;5 days if significant sheathing repair is needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Weather affects siding installation timelines, especially for fiber cement and painted wood products that need dry conditions for cutting, painting, and caulking. We schedule work around the forecast and protect exposed areas if rain arrives unexpectedly. We provide a detailed schedule at the start of every project and keep you informed if conditions cause any adjustments.</p>

        <h2>Permits for Siding in Everett</h2>
        <p>Siding replacement generally requires a building permit in the City of Everett and Snohomish County. Permits are typically triggered when the work involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full removal and replacement of exterior siding</li>
          <li>Changes to the exterior wall assembly (adding insulation, changing sheathing)</li>
          <li>Alterations that affect the fire rating of exterior walls</li>
          <li>Any structural modifications to the wall framing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Minor repairs, such as replacing a few damaged boards without changing the wall assembly, typically do not require a permit. We handle the permit application and inspection process as part of our service. Permits ensure the work meets current building codes and protect you as the homeowner.</p>

        <h2>Why Everett Homeowners Choose NW General Contractor for Siding</h2>
        <p>Siding installation in the Pacific Northwest requires more than just picking a color and nailing it up. The constant moisture exposure in Snohomish County means that the details behind the siding &mdash; house wrap, flashing, caulking, and ventilation &mdash; are what determine whether your exterior lasts 10 years or 50. We have seen too many homes where shortcuts in the moisture management layer led to extensive rot and mold behind siding that still looked fine from the street.</p>
        <p>We install siding the right way, following manufacturer specifications and best practices for the Pacific Northwest climate. We are licensed, bonded, and insured in Washington state. We provide clear written estimates, maintain clean and safe job sites, and communicate proactively about schedule and progress. Our goal is an exterior that protects your home, looks great, and lasts for decades without unexpected problems.</p>
