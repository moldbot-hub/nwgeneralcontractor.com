        <h2>Transform Your Kitchen with a Contractor You Can Trust</h2>
        <p>The kitchen is the most-used room in your home. It is where meals happen, where the family gathers, and where friends end up during every party. If your kitchen no longer works for the way you live, a well-planned remodel can change everything about your daily routine.</p>
        <p>At NW General Contractor, we specialize in kitchen remodeling throughout Everett and Snohomish County. Whether you are updating worn-out surfaces, reconfiguring a cramped layout, or building a fully custom kitchen from the studs out, our team handles every phase of the project from design through final walkthrough.</p>

        <h2>Our Kitchen Remodeling Services</h2>
        <p>Every kitchen remodel is different. Some homeowners want a quick facelift. Others want a complete transformation. We tailor the scope to your goals, your budget, and your timeline. Here is what we commonly handle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Custom Cabinetry</strong> &mdash; Semi-custom and fully custom cabinets in a range of wood species, finishes, and configurations. Soft-close hinges, pull-out shelving, lazy susans, and built-in organizers are all standard options we offer.</li>
          <li><strong>Countertop Installation</strong> &mdash; Quartz, granite, butcher block, marble, and solid surface countertops. We template, fabricate, and install with precision seams and proper support.</li>
          <li><strong>Flooring</strong> &mdash; Hardwood, porcelain tile, luxury vinyl plank (LVP), and natural stone. We help you choose a material that balances durability, maintenance, and style for a high-traffic kitchen environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Lighting Design</strong> &mdash; Recessed lighting, under-cabinet LED strips, pendant fixtures over islands, and task lighting at work zones. Good kitchen lighting is functional and atmospheric.</li>
          <li><strong>Appliance Installation</strong> &mdash; We coordinate with your appliance supplier to ensure proper electrical, gas, and ventilation hookups. Built-in refrigerators, range hoods, dishwashers, and microwaves are all part of the process.</li>
          <li><strong>Layout Redesign &amp; Open Concept Conversions</strong> &mdash; Removing walls to create open-concept living, reconfiguring the work triangle, adding islands, and improving flow between the kitchen, dining, and living areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Plumbing &amp; Electrical Upgrades</strong> &mdash; Moving sink locations, adding dedicated circuits for appliances, upgrading to GFCI outlets, and ensuring your kitchen meets current code.</li>
          <li><strong>Backsplash &amp; Tile Work</strong> &mdash; Subway tile, mosaic patterns, natural stone, and large-format porcelain. We handle the layout and installation for a clean, lasting result.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Countertop Materials: Choosing the Right Surface</h2>
        <p>The countertop is one of the most visible and most-used surfaces in your kitchen. Choosing the right material matters for both daily function and long-term satisfaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Quartz</strong> is the most popular choice among our Everett clients. It is engineered stone, which means it is non-porous, stain-resistant, and does not require sealing. It comes in a wide range of colors and patterns, including options that closely mimic the look of natural marble or granite. Brands like Cambria, Caesarstone, and Silestone offer extensive selections.</p>
        <p><strong>Granite</strong> remains a strong option for homeowners who prefer natural stone. Each slab is unique, and granite holds up well to heat. It does require periodic sealing to maintain its stain resistance, but many homeowners appreciate the natural variation and depth of real stone.</p>
        <p><strong>Butcher block</strong> adds warmth and character, especially in farmhouse-style or transitional kitchens. It requires more maintenance than stone surfaces, including oiling and sanding, but it can be refinished multiple times over its lifespan. Many homeowners use butcher block on an island while keeping stone on the perimeter counters.</p>

        <h2>What Does a Kitchen Remodel Cost in Everett?</h2>
        <p>Kitchen remodeling costs vary based on scope, materials, and the age of the home. Here are the general ranges we see for projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic refresh</strong> ($22,000 &ndash; $30,000): New countertops, cabinet refacing or painting, updated hardware, backsplash, and new flooring. Layout stays the same.</li>
          <li><strong>Mid-range remodel</strong> ($30,000 &ndash; $45,000): New cabinets, stone countertops, new appliances, updated lighting, and possibly minor layout adjustments.</li>
          <li><strong>Full custom renovation</strong> ($45,000 &ndash; $60,000+): Structural changes, wall removal, custom cabinetry, premium materials, relocation of plumbing or electrical, and new flooring throughout.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to the National Association of Realtors, a mid-range kitchen remodel recoups approximately 77.6% of the investment at resale. In the Snohomish County housing market, where move-in-ready homes command premium prices, a modern kitchen can significantly shorten time on market and increase buyer interest.</p>

        <h2>Our Kitchen Remodeling Process</h2>
        <p>We follow a structured process to keep your project on track and on budget. Here is what to expect:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Initial Consultation &amp; Site Visit</strong> &mdash; We visit your home, discuss your goals, review the existing space, and talk through budget expectations. This visit is free and comes with no obligation.</li>
          <li><strong>Design &amp; Material Selection</strong> &mdash; We work with you to finalize the layout, select materials, and create a detailed scope of work. You will know exactly what is included before we start.</li>
          <li><strong>Permits &amp; Scheduling</strong> &mdash; We handle permit applications with the City of Everett or Snohomish County, order materials, and schedule subcontractors. We confirm the start date and project timeline with you in writing.</li>
          <li><strong>Demolition &amp; Rough-In</strong> &mdash; Existing cabinets, countertops, and flooring are removed. Framing, electrical, and plumbing rough-in work is completed and inspected.</li>
          <li><strong>Installation</strong> &mdash; Cabinets are installed and leveled, countertops are templated and set, flooring goes down, and appliances are hooked up. Backsplash, lighting, and trim work follow.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Walkthrough</strong> &mdash; We walk the completed kitchen with you, address any punch-list items, and make sure everything meets your expectations before we call the project done.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does a Kitchen Remodel Take?</h2>
        <p>Most kitchen remodels in Everett take between 4 and 8 weeks from the start of demolition to the final walkthrough. Here is a rough breakdown:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Demolition: 2&ndash;3 days</li>
          <li>Rough-in (electrical, plumbing, framing): 1&ndash;2 weeks</li>
          <li>Drywall, paint, and prep: 3&ndash;5 days</li>
          <li>Cabinet installation: 3&ndash;5 days</li>
          <li>Countertop fabrication and installation: 1&ndash;2 weeks (template to install)</li>
          <li>Flooring, backsplash, and finish work: 1 week</li>
          <li>Appliance hookup and punch list: 2&ndash;3 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Timelines can shift depending on permit processing times, material lead times (especially for custom cabinets or specialty stone), and the extent of any structural changes. We provide a detailed schedule at the start of every project and keep you updated throughout.</p>

        <h2>Permits for Kitchen Remodeling in Everett</h2>
        <p>Not every kitchen remodel requires a permit, but many do. In the City of Everett and Snohomish County, permits are generally required when the work involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Electrical changes (adding circuits, moving outlets, panel upgrades)</li>
          <li>Plumbing changes (moving a sink, adding a gas line)</li>
          <li>Structural modifications (removing or altering load-bearing walls)</li>
          <li>Changes to ventilation or HVAC ductwork</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cosmetic updates like painting, replacing countertops on existing bases, or swapping out a faucet typically do not require a permit. We handle the permit process as part of our service, including application, inspections, and final sign-off.</p>
