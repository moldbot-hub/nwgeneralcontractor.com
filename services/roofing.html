        <h2>Reliable Roofing from a Contractor Who Knows the Pacific Northwest</h2>
        <p>Your roof is the first line of defense against everything the Puget Sound climate throws at your home. Between persistent rain, wind-driven storms, moss growth, and the occasional heavy snowfall, roofing materials in Snohomish County take a beating that most parts of the country never see. When your roof starts showing its age, acting quickly is the difference between a manageable repair and a costly interior damage problem.</p>
        <p>At NW General Contractor, we provide full-service roofing for homeowners throughout Everett and Snohomish County. Whether you need a few shingles replaced after a windstorm or a complete tear-off and reroof, our crew handles the job from initial inspection through final cleanup. We are licensed, bonded, and insured in Washington state, and we stand behind every roof we install.</p>

        <h2>Our Roofing Services</h2>
        <p>Roofing needs range from small repairs to full-scale replacement. We tailor the scope of work to the actual condition of your roof, your budget, and your long-term plans for the home. Here is what we handle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Roof Replacement</strong> &mdash; Complete tear-off of the existing roofing material down to the deck, followed by inspection, repair of any damaged sheathing, and installation of new underlayment, flashing, and roofing material. We install asphalt architectural shingles, standing seam metal, and composite roofing systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Roof Repair</strong> &mdash; Targeted fixes for damaged, missing, or deteriorating shingles, cracked flashing, worn pipe boots, and localized leaks. We identify the root cause and repair it properly rather than covering up symptoms.</li>
          <li><strong>Leak Detection &amp; Diagnosis</strong> &mdash; Water stains on your ceiling do not always point to the obvious spot overhead. We trace leaks to their true source using systematic inspection methods, then provide a clear repair plan.</li>
          <li><strong>Gutter Installation &amp; Replacement</strong> &mdash; Seamless aluminum gutters, downspouts, gutter guards, and proper drainage routing. Functioning gutters are essential in western Washington to direct water away from your foundation and siding.</li>
          <li><strong>Roof Inspection</strong> &mdash; Detailed assessment of your roof condition including shingle integrity, flashing, ventilation, moss and debris, and structural concerns. We provide a written report with photos and honest recommendations.</li>
          <li><strong>Ventilation &amp; Insulation</strong> &mdash; Proper attic ventilation prevents moisture buildup, ice damming, and premature shingle failure. We install ridge vents, soffit vents, and power ventilators to keep your attic dry and your energy bills down.</li>
          <li><strong>Skylight Installation</strong> &mdash; New skylight installation or replacement of aging, leaking skylights. We use curb-mounted and deck-mounted options from Velux and similar manufacturers, properly flashed and sealed for the Pacific Northwest climate.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency Tarping &amp; Storm Damage</strong> &mdash; When a storm damages your roof, we respond quickly to tarp exposed areas and prevent further water intrusion. We also help document damage for insurance claims.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Roofing Materials: Choosing the Right Option for Your Home</h2>
        <p>The material you choose for your roof affects everything from curb appeal to lifespan to long-term maintenance costs. In the Pacific Northwest, moisture resistance and durability in wet conditions are the top priorities.</p>
        <p><strong>Asphalt architectural shingles</strong> are the most popular roofing choice in Snohomish County. They offer a strong balance of cost, appearance, and performance. Modern architectural shingles (also called dimensional or laminate shingles) are thicker and more durable than traditional three-tab shingles, with rated lifespans of 25 to 50 years depending on the product line. Brands like CertainTeed, GAF, and Owens Corning all manufacture high-quality options suited to western Washington conditions. They resist algae growth, withstand moderate wind, and come in a wide range of colors and profiles.</p>
        <p><strong>Metal roofing</strong> is gaining popularity across Everett and the surrounding area. Standing seam metal panels shed water and debris efficiently, resist moss and algae entirely, and can last 50 years or more with virtually no maintenance. Metal roofing is also fire-resistant and recyclable. The upfront cost is higher than asphalt, but the extended lifespan and low maintenance often make it the more economical choice over the life of the home.</p>
        <p><strong>Composite and synthetic roofing</strong> materials replicate the look of cedar shake, slate, or tile without the weight and maintenance demands of the real thing. These products are engineered for impact resistance, fire resistance, and longevity. They are a good fit for homeowners who want a distinctive look without the drawbacks of natural materials in a wet climate.</p>

        <h2>What Does Roofing Cost in Everett?</h2>
        <p>Roofing costs depend on the size of your roof, the pitch and complexity of the roof lines, the material selected, and whether underlying sheathing needs repair. Here are the general ranges we see for projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic repair</strong> ($500 &ndash; $3,000): Replacing damaged shingles, fixing flashing, resealing pipe boots, and addressing localized leaks. Most minor repairs fall in this range.</li>
          <li><strong>Re-roof with asphalt shingles</strong> ($8,000 &ndash; $15,000): Full tear-off and replacement with architectural asphalt shingles on a standard single-family home. Includes underlayment, flashing, ridge cap, and cleanup.</li>
          <li><strong>Full replacement with premium materials</strong> ($15,000 &ndash; $30,000+): Standing seam metal, high-end composite, or multi-layer systems with enhanced warranties. Includes any necessary deck repair, upgraded ventilation, and extended labor warranties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A new roof is one of the highest-return investments you can make in your home. According to the 2024 Cost vs. Value Report, a new asphalt roof recoups approximately 65% of the cost at resale. Beyond the financial return, a sound roof prevents the cascading damage that water intrusion causes to insulation, framing, drywall, and electrical systems.</p>

        <h2>Our Roofing Process</h2>
        <p>We follow a clear, structured process for every roofing project. Here is what to expect from start to finish:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Inspection &amp; Assessment</strong> &mdash; We inspect your roof from the ground, from the ladder, and from the attic. We check shingle condition, flashing, ventilation, decking, and structural integrity. You receive a written report with photos and our honest recommendation.</li>
          <li><strong>Detailed Quote</strong> &mdash; We provide a written estimate that breaks down materials, labor, permits, and disposal costs. No hidden fees. You know exactly what you are paying for before work begins.</li>
          <li><strong>Material Selection</strong> &mdash; We walk you through material options, color choices, and warranty levels. We order materials and confirm the installation schedule.</li>
          <li><strong>Tear-Off &amp; Deck Inspection</strong> &mdash; Existing roofing material is removed down to the sheathing. We inspect the deck for rot, soft spots, or damage and replace any compromised sections before moving forward.</li>
          <li><strong>Installation</strong> &mdash; New underlayment is rolled out, flashing is installed at valleys, walls, and penetrations, and roofing material is applied according to manufacturer specifications. Ridge vents, pipe boots, and drip edge are all installed as part of the system.</li>
          <li><strong>Cleanup &amp; Final Inspection</strong> &mdash; We use tarps and magnetic nail sweepers to leave your property clean. A final walkthrough confirms the work meets our standards and yours. We provide warranty documentation and maintenance recommendations.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does a Roofing Project Take?</h2>
        <p>Roofing timelines depend on the scope of work, weather conditions, and the complexity of your roof. Here is what to expect for typical projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minor repairs: 1&ndash;3 days</li>
          <li>Standard re-roof (asphalt shingles): 3&ndash;5 days</li>
          <li>Full replacement with premium materials: 1&ndash;2 weeks</li>
          <li>Metal roofing installation: 1&ndash;2 weeks</li>
          <li>Emergency tarping: Same day or next day</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Weather is the biggest variable for roofing work in western Washington. We monitor the forecast closely and schedule work during dry windows whenever possible. For full replacements, we plan the tear-off and waterproofing stages to be completed within a single day to minimize exposure. If rain is expected, we tarp any exposed sections before the crew leaves for the day.</p>

        <h2>Permits for Roofing in Everett</h2>
        <p>Permit requirements for roofing work vary depending on the scope of the project. In the City of Everett and Snohomish County, permits are generally required when the work involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full roof replacement (tear-off and re-roof)</li>
          <li>Structural modifications to the roof deck or framing</li>
          <li>Adding or relocating skylights</li>
          <li>Changes to roof ventilation that affect the building envelope</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Minor repairs such as replacing a few shingles or fixing flashing typically do not require a permit. We handle the permit application and inspection process as part of our service so you do not have to deal with the city directly.</p>

        <h2>Why Everett Homeowners Choose NW General Contractor for Roofing</h2>
        <p>We are roofing contractors who understand the specific demands of the Pacific Northwest climate. Moss, persistent moisture, windstorms, and temperature swings all create conditions that shorten roof life if the installation is not done right. We use materials rated for the region, follow manufacturer installation specs to maintain warranty coverage, and pay close attention to the details &mdash; flashing, ventilation, drip edge &mdash; that make the difference between a roof that lasts and one that fails early.</p>
        <p>We are licensed, bonded, and insured in Washington state. We provide transparent pricing, communicate clearly throughout the project, and leave your property clean when we are done. Whether you need a quick repair or a full replacement, we treat your home like it matters &mdash; because it does.</p>
