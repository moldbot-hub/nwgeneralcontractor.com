        <h2>Protect Your Home from the Ground Up</h2>
        <p>Your foundation carries the full weight of your home, and in the Pacific Northwest, it also fights a constant battle against water. The heavy rainfall, high water tables, and clay-rich soils common across Snohomish County create conditions that stress foundations year after year. Cracks develop, water finds its way in, and small problems become expensive structural issues if they are not addressed. The good news is that most foundation problems can be repaired effectively when caught early.</p>
        <p>At NW General Contractor, we provide comprehensive foundation repair services for homeowners throughout Everett and Snohomish County. From hairline crack sealing to full structural piering, we diagnose the root cause of the problem and fix it properly. We are licensed, bonded, and insured in Washington state, and we approach every foundation project with the thoroughness it demands &mdash; because your foundation is not something you get a second chance on.</p>

        <h2>Our Foundation Repair Services</h2>
        <p>Foundation problems come in many forms, and the right repair depends entirely on accurate diagnosis. We take the time to understand what is actually happening before recommending a solution. Here is what we handle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Foundation Crack Repair</strong> &mdash; Sealing and structural repair of cracks in poured concrete walls, block foundations, and slabs. We use epoxy injection for structural cracks that need to bond back together, and polyurethane foam injection for non-structural cracks where the goal is waterproofing and flexibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> &mdash; Exterior and interior waterproofing systems to stop water from reaching your foundation walls. Exterior waterproofing involves excavation, application of membrane or coating, and installation of drainage board. Interior systems include sealants, vapor barriers, and sump pump installation.</li>
          <li><strong>French Drain Installation</strong> &mdash; Perimeter drainage systems that intercept groundwater before it reaches your foundation. We install both exterior French drains (around the foundation footing) and interior perimeter drains (inside the crawl space or basement) depending on the site conditions and the source of the water.</li>
          <li><strong>Crawl Space Encapsulation</strong> &mdash; Full sealing of the crawl space with heavy-duty vapor barrier, sealed vents, insulation, and dehumidification. Encapsulation prevents moisture from rising through the soil and damaging your floor joists, subfloor, and the air quality inside your home. This is one of the most impactful upgrades for Pacific Northwest homes.</li>
          <li><strong>Seismic Retrofit</strong> &mdash; Securing your home to its foundation to prevent it from sliding off during an earthquake. Western Washington sits in an active seismic zone, and many older homes in Snohomish County are not bolted to their foundations. We install anchor bolts, Simpson hold-downs, and cripple wall bracing to meet current seismic standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Pier &amp; Beam Repair</strong> &mdash; Repair and replacement of deteriorated piers, posts, beams, and joists in crawl space foundations. We replace rotted wood, install concrete piers, and sister or replace damaged floor joists to restore structural support under your home.</li>
          <li><strong>Settling Correction</strong> &mdash; When a foundation settles unevenly, it causes cracking, sloping floors, and structural stress throughout the home. We use steel push piers, helical piers, or slab jacking to stabilize and lift settled foundations back toward their original position.</li>
          <li><strong>Concrete Patching &amp; Resurfacing</strong> &mdash; Repair of spalling, flaking, or deteriorated concrete on foundation walls, footings, and slabs. We remove damaged material, treat exposed rebar if present, and apply structural repair mortar or polymer-modified concrete to restore the surface.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Repair Methods: Understanding Your Options</h2>
        <p>The right repair method depends on the type of damage, the cause of the problem, and the construction of your foundation. Here is an overview of the primary methods we use and when each is appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>Epoxy injection</strong> is used for structural crack repair in poured concrete foundations. Epoxy bonds the crack back together with a material that is actually stronger than the surrounding concrete. It restores the structural integrity of the wall and creates a waterproof seal. Epoxy is rigid, which makes it ideal for cracks that are no longer moving. For cracks that are still active (seasonal expansion and contraction), we use <strong>polyurethane foam injection</strong> instead. Polyurethane remains flexible after curing, accommodating minor movement while maintaining a waterproof seal. It is the preferred method for non-structural cracks and for stopping active water leaks.</p>
        <p><strong>Exterior waterproofing membranes</strong> are the most effective long-term solution for persistent water intrusion. The process involves excavating down to the foundation footing, cleaning and repairing the wall surface, applying a rubberized asphalt or sheet membrane, installing a drainage board to protect the membrane and direct water downward, and backfilling with draining gravel. This method addresses water at its source &mdash; before it reaches the wall &mdash; and is the gold standard for below-grade waterproofing.</p>
        <p><strong>Interior drainage systems</strong> are a practical alternative when exterior excavation is not feasible or when water is entering from beneath the slab. A perimeter drain channel is installed along the interior base of the foundation wall, connected to a sump pit with an automatic pump. Water that enters is captured and pumped out before it can pool or cause damage. Interior systems are less disruptive to install and work well in combination with crawl space encapsulation.</p>

        <h2>What Does Foundation Repair Cost in Everett?</h2>
        <p>Foundation repair costs vary significantly based on the severity of the problem, the repair method required, and the accessibility of the work area. Here are the general ranges we see for projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Minor crack repair</strong> ($500 &ndash; $2,000): Sealing hairline to moderate cracks with epoxy or polyurethane injection. Straightforward repairs that typically take a day or less.</li>
          <li><strong>Moderate repair</strong> ($3,000 &ndash; $8,000): French drain installation, crawl space encapsulation, multiple crack repairs, or targeted waterproofing. These projects address ongoing moisture problems and prevent further deterioration.</li>
          <li><strong>Major structural repair</strong> ($10,000 &ndash; $25,000+): Foundation piering, significant settling correction, full exterior waterproofing with excavation, or seismic retrofit. These are larger-scope projects that address serious structural concerns and protect the long-term stability of the home.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Foundation repair is not a place to cut corners. Unresolved foundation problems get worse over time, and the cost of repair increases as damage progresses. A $2,000 crack repair today can prevent a $20,000 structural repair five years from now. We provide honest assessments and will tell you if a problem is cosmetic and does not need immediate intervention.</p>

        <h2>Our Foundation Repair Process</h2>
        <p>Foundation work requires careful diagnosis before any repair begins. Treating symptoms without understanding the cause leads to recurring problems. Here is our process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Inspection &amp; Assessment</strong> &mdash; We conduct a thorough inspection of the foundation, crawl space, and exterior grading. We check for cracks, water intrusion, settling, structural movement, moisture levels, and drainage conditions. We use levels, measuring tools, and moisture meters to build a complete picture of the situation.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnosis &amp; Report</strong> &mdash; We identify the root cause of the problem &mdash; whether it is hydrostatic pressure, poor drainage, soil settlement, structural overload, or seismic vulnerability. You receive a written report with photos, measurements, and our honest assessment of the severity.</li>
          <li><strong>Repair Plan &amp; Estimate</strong> &mdash; We develop a repair plan that addresses both the symptoms and the underlying cause. The written estimate details the scope of work, materials, timeline, and cost. We explain the options and help you prioritize if budget is a concern.</li>
          <li><strong>Excavation (If Needed)</strong> &mdash; For exterior waterproofing or piering, we excavate along the foundation to the footing. We protect landscaping and hardscaping as much as possible and use proper shoring techniques to keep the excavation safe.</li>
          <li><strong>Repair</strong> &mdash; Cracks are injected, membranes are applied, drains are installed, piers are driven, or structural members are replaced &mdash; whatever the plan calls for. We follow manufacturer specifications and engineering requirements for every method we use.</li>
          <li><strong>Waterproofing &amp; Drainage</strong> &mdash; After structural repairs are complete, we address water management. This may include membrane application, drain tile installation, sump pump setup, grading corrections, or crawl space vapor barrier installation.</li>
          <li><strong>Backfill &amp; Grade</strong> &mdash; Excavated areas are backfilled with appropriate material (typically draining gravel near the foundation, then native soil above), compacted properly, and graded to direct surface water away from the house.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Inspection &amp; Documentation</strong> &mdash; We walk the completed work with you, explain what was done and why, provide maintenance recommendations, and hand over warranty documentation. If permits were pulled, we coordinate the final inspection with the city.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does Foundation Repair Take?</h2>
        <p>Foundation repair timelines depend on the scope and complexity of the work. Here is what to expect for typical projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Crack injection (epoxy or polyurethane): 1&ndash;2 days</li>
          <li>French drain installation (interior): 2&ndash;4 days</li>
          <li>Crawl space encapsulation: 2&ndash;5 days</li>
          <li>Exterior waterproofing with excavation: 1&ndash;2 weeks</li>
          <li>Pier installation and settling correction: 1&ndash;2 weeks</li>
          <li>Seismic retrofit: 3&ndash;7 days</li>
          <li>Major structural repair with multiple components: 2&ndash;3 weeks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Weather can affect scheduling for exterior excavation work, especially during the rainy months. We plan around the forecast and protect exposed work areas when rain is expected. Interior work such as crawl space encapsulation, crack injection, and interior drainage can proceed regardless of weather conditions.</p>

        <h2>Permits for Foundation Repair in Everett</h2>
        <p>Permit requirements for foundation work depend on the nature and scope of the repair. In the City of Everett and Snohomish County, permits are generally required when the work involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structural modifications to the foundation (piering, underpinning, wall reinforcement)</li>
          <li>Seismic retrofit work (anchor bolts, hold-downs, cripple wall bracing)</li>
          <li>Changes to the building's drainage or grading that affect neighboring properties</li>
          <li>Alterations to the crawl space that change ventilation or fire separation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Routine maintenance such as crack sealing, waterproof coatings, and minor concrete patching generally do not require permits. We determine permit requirements during the assessment phase and handle all applications, inspections, and approvals as part of our service.</p>

        <h2>Why Everett Homeowners Choose NW General Contractor for Foundation Repair</h2>
        <p>Foundation repair is specialized work that demands accurate diagnosis and proven methods. In Snohomish County, the combination of heavy rainfall, high water tables, and glacial till soils creates conditions that challenge foundations in ways that are specific to this region. We understand these conditions because we work in them every day. We know which soils drain and which hold water, which neighborhoods have high water tables, and which era of construction is prone to which types of foundation problems.</p>
        <p>We are licensed, bonded, and insured in Washington state. We do not use high-pressure sales tactics or try to scare homeowners into unnecessary repairs. We give you an honest assessment of the situation, explain your options, and help you make an informed decision. If a crack is cosmetic and does not need structural repair, we will tell you. If the problem is serious and needs immediate attention, we will explain exactly why and what the consequences of waiting would be. Our goal is to protect your home's structural integrity and give you confidence that the problem has been properly resolved.</p>
