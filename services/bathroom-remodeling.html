        <h2>Professional Bathroom Remodeling Throughout Snohomish County</h2>
        <p>A bathroom remodel is one of the smartest investments you can make in your home. Whether it is the primary bathroom that needs a complete overhaul or a guest bath that has not been updated in decades, a well-executed renovation improves your daily routine, increases your home's value, and eliminates the problems that come with aging fixtures and outdated plumbing.</p>
        <p>NW General Contractor provides full-service bathroom remodeling for homeowners in Everett, Marysville, Lake Stevens, Lynnwood, and communities across Snohomish County. We handle everything from initial design through final walkthrough, including plumbing, electrical, tile work, and finish carpentry.</p>

        <h2>Our Bathroom Remodeling Services</h2>
        <p>We offer a complete range of bathroom renovation services, tailored to your needs and budget:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Custom Tile Work</strong> &mdash; Floor-to-ceiling tile in showers, accent walls, floor tile, and niche installations. We work with porcelain, ceramic, natural stone, and glass mosaic tiles in patterns ranging from classic subway to large-format modern.</li>
          <li><strong>Vanity Installation</strong> &mdash; Single and double vanities in floating, freestanding, and built-in configurations. We source from top manufacturers and also build custom vanities to fit non-standard spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Walk-In Showers</strong> &mdash; Frameless glass enclosures, curbless entry for accessibility, bench seating, multiple shower heads, and custom tile work. Walk-in showers are the most requested upgrade in bathroom remodeling today.</li>
          <li><strong>Tub-to-Shower Conversions</strong> &mdash; Replacing an underused bathtub with a spacious walk-in shower. This is especially popular in primary bathrooms where homeowners want more functional shower space.</li>
          <li><strong>Soaker Tubs &amp; Freestanding Tubs</strong> &mdash; For bathrooms with enough space, a freestanding soaker tub creates a focal point and adds a luxury feel. We handle the plumbing relocation and floor reinforcement needed for proper installation.</li>
          <li><strong>Heated Floors</strong> &mdash; Electric radiant heating mats installed beneath tile flooring. This is a highly popular upgrade in the Pacific Northwest, where cold mornings are common for much of the year.</li>
          <li><strong>Custom Lighting</strong> &mdash; Vanity sconces, recessed ceiling lights, shower niche lighting, and dimmable fixtures. Proper bathroom lighting eliminates shadows at the mirror and creates a comfortable atmosphere.</li>
          <li><strong>Plumbing Upgrades</strong> &mdash; New supply lines, drain relocations, water heater connections, and fixture installations. We bring older plumbing up to current code and ensure reliable performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Ventilation</strong> &mdash; Properly sized exhaust fans with humidity sensors to prevent mold and moisture damage. Many older Everett homes have undersized or poorly vented bathroom fans.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bathroom Remodel Costs in Everett</h2>
        <p>The cost of a bathroom remodel depends on the size of the space, the scope of work, and your material choices. Here are the typical ranges we see for projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic update</strong> ($6,000 &ndash; $12,000): New vanity, faucet, toilet, mirror, lighting, and fresh paint. Existing tile and layout stay in place.</li>
          <li><strong>Mid-range remodel</strong> ($12,000 &ndash; $22,000): New tile floors and shower surround, updated vanity and countertop, new fixtures, improved lighting, and ventilation upgrade.</li>
          <li><strong>Full custom renovation</strong> ($22,000 &ndash; $35,000+): Complete gut renovation with layout changes, custom tile work, walk-in shower with frameless glass, heated floors, freestanding tub, and premium fixtures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A mid-range bathroom remodel recoups approximately 70.1% of the investment at resale. Beyond the financial return, an updated bathroom removes daily frustrations and can be one of the most satisfying home improvements you make.</p>

        <h2>Walk-In Showers: The Most Popular Bathroom Upgrade</h2>
        <p>Walk-in showers have become the centerpiece of modern bathroom design. They offer several advantages over traditional tub-shower combos:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>More usable space</strong> &mdash; Without a tub taking up floor area, the shower enclosure can be larger and more comfortable.</li>
          <li><strong>Better accessibility</strong> &mdash; Curbless or low-curb entry makes the shower accessible for all ages and mobility levels. This is an important consideration for aging-in-place planning.</li>
          <li><strong>Easier cleaning</strong> &mdash; Frameless glass and large-format tile panels mean fewer grout lines and no shower curtain to deal with.</li>
          <li><strong>Modern aesthetic</strong> &mdash; A well-designed walk-in shower with frameless glass creates an open, spa-like feel that transforms the entire bathroom.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We build walk-in showers with proper waterproofing systems, including Schluter KERDI membrane and Laticrete Hydro Ban, to ensure long-term performance. Proper waterproofing is the most critical component of any shower installation and the area where cutting corners leads to the most expensive failures.</p>

        <h2>Tub-to-Shower Conversions</h2>
        <p>Many homes in Snohomish County were built with bathtub-shower combinations in the primary bathroom. If you rarely use the tub and would prefer a larger, more functional shower, a tub-to-shower conversion is a straightforward project that makes a significant difference in daily use.</p>
        <p>The process involves removing the existing tub, reconfiguring the drain and supply plumbing, building a new shower pan (either tiled or pre-formed), installing tile or wall panels, and adding a glass enclosure. Most tub-to-shower conversions can be completed in 7 to 10 working days.</p>
        <p>One important note: we recommend keeping at least one bathtub in the home. If you have a two-bathroom home, converting the primary bath to a walk-in shower while keeping the tub in the guest bath is the ideal configuration for both daily use and future resale.</p>

        <h2>Heated Bathroom Floors</h2>
        <p>Radiant heated floors are one of the most requested upgrades among our Everett clients. Electric radiant mats are installed directly beneath the tile floor during the remodeling process, adding minimal height to the floor assembly.</p>
        <p>The system is controlled by a programmable thermostat, so you can set it to warm the floor before you wake up in the morning. Operating costs are modest, typically $10 to $20 per month for a standard bathroom, depending on usage and electricity rates. The comfort factor is significant, especially during the cool, damp months that define the Pacific Northwest climate from October through May.</p>

        <h2>Our Bathroom Remodeling Process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Free Consultation</strong> &mdash; We visit your home, measure the space, discuss your priorities, and review material options. We leave you with a clear understanding of what is possible within your budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Design &amp; Material Selection</strong> &mdash; We finalize the layout, help you select tile, fixtures, vanities, and hardware, and produce a detailed written estimate covering every line item.</li>
          <li><strong>Permits</strong> &mdash; We submit permit applications as needed and schedule inspections at the appropriate stages.</li>
          <li><strong>Demolition &amp; Rough-In</strong> &mdash; We remove existing fixtures, address any hidden issues (water damage, subfloor rot, outdated plumbing), and complete the rough plumbing and electrical work.</li>
          <li><strong>Waterproofing &amp; Tile</strong> &mdash; Shower pan construction, membrane installation, and tile work. This is the most time-intensive phase and the one that requires the most precision.</li>
          <li><strong>Fixtures &amp; Finish</strong> &mdash; Vanity, toilet, mirror, lighting, accessories, and final plumbing connections. Caulking, grouting, and cleanup follow.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Walkthrough</strong> &mdash; We walk through the completed bathroom with you, test every fixture, and address any remaining items before closing out the project.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does a Bathroom Remodel Take?</h2>
        <p>Most bathroom remodels in Everett take between 2 and 4 weeks. A straightforward fixture and surface update can be completed in about 2 weeks, while a full gut renovation with custom tile and layout changes typically takes 3 to 4 weeks. Factors that can extend the timeline include permit processing, special-order materials, and any unexpected conditions discovered during demolition (water damage, outdated wiring, or deteriorated subfloor).</p>
