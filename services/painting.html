        <h2>Fresh Paint Changes Everything About a Home</h2>
        <p>Nothing transforms a space faster or more dramatically than a professional paint job. A fresh coat of paint can make a tired room feel brand new, boost your curb appeal from the street, and protect your home from the elements. In the Pacific Northwest, where rain and moisture are a constant, quality painting is not just cosmetic &mdash; it is essential maintenance that protects your investment.</p>
        <p>At NW General Contractor, we provide comprehensive interior and exterior painting services throughout Everett and Snohomish County. We use premium paints, invest serious time in surface preparation, and deliver clean, lasting results that hold up to the PNW climate. Whether you need a single accent wall or a complete exterior repaint, we handle every step from color consultation to final cleanup.</p>

        <h2>Our Painting Services</h2>
        <p>Every painting project has different needs. Some homeowners want a quick refresh. Others are preparing to sell or just moved into a home that needs a total color overhaul. We scale our services to match your goals and budget:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interior Painting</strong> &mdash; Walls, ceilings, trim, doors, and closets. We protect your floors and furniture, cut clean lines, and apply two coats of premium paint for even, lasting coverage in every room.</li>
          <li><strong>Exterior Painting</strong> &mdash; Full exterior repaints including siding, trim, fascia, soffits, and gutters. We power-wash, scrape, prime, and caulk before applying weather-resistant paint rated for the Pacific Northwest climate.</li>
          <li><strong>Cabinet Painting &amp; Refinishing</strong> &mdash; A cost-effective alternative to replacing kitchen or bathroom cabinets. We sand, prime, and spray multiple coats of durable enamel for a factory-smooth finish that holds up to daily use.</li>
          <li><strong>Deck Staining &amp; Sealing</strong> &mdash; Cedar and composite deck staining, sealing, and restoration. We clean the surface, apply UV-resistant stain, and seal against moisture to extend the life of your deck in our wet climate.</li>
          <li><strong>Pressure Washing</strong> &mdash; Driveways, walkways, siding, fences, and patios. Pressure washing removes years of moss, mildew, and grime and is often the first step before any exterior painting project.</li>
          <li><strong>Drywall Repair &amp; Texturing</strong> &mdash; Patching holes, fixing cracks, skim-coating damaged areas, and matching existing wall textures. We make the repairs invisible before the paint goes on.</li>
          <li><strong>Trim &amp; Accent Painting</strong> &mdash; Crown molding, baseboards, window casings, door frames, and decorative accents. Detail work that requires a steady hand and careful masking for crisp, professional edges.</li>
          <li><strong>Color Consultation</strong> &mdash; Not sure what colors to choose? We help you select palettes that complement your home's architecture, lighting, and style. We can provide sample swatches applied directly to your walls so you can see the color in your space before committing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Premium Paints Built for the Pacific Northwest</h2>
        <p>The paint you choose matters as much as the skill of the painter. In the Pacific Northwest, moisture, rain, and limited sun exposure put unique demands on both interior and exterior coatings. We use professional-grade paints from Benjamin Moore and Sherwin-Williams because they perform consistently in our climate and offer the best color retention and durability.</p>
        <p>For exteriors, we recommend 100% acrylic latex formulas with built-in mildew resistance. Products like Benjamin Moore Aura Exterior and Sherwin-Williams Duration provide excellent adhesion, resist cracking and peeling, and maintain their color despite months of overcast skies and rain. For homes in heavily shaded areas where moss and algae growth are common, we use coatings with antimicrobial additives to slow biological growth on painted surfaces.</p>
        <p>Choosing the right sheen is also important. Flat finishes hide surface imperfections and work well on ceilings and low-traffic walls. Eggshell and satin are ideal for living rooms, bedrooms, and hallways because they are easier to clean while still providing a subtle finish. Semi-gloss is the standard for kitchens, bathrooms, trim, and doors because it resists moisture and wipes clean easily. We walk you through these choices so you get the right product in every room.</p>

        <h2>What Does a Painting Project Cost in Everett?</h2>
        <p>Painting costs depend on the size of the area, the condition of the surfaces, and the quality of materials selected. Here are the general ranges we see for projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single room interior</strong> ($400 &ndash; $800): One standard bedroom or living room including walls, ceiling, and trim. Two coats of premium paint, all prep work included.</li>
          <li><strong>Whole house interior</strong> ($3,000 &ndash; $8,000): Full interior repaint for a typical 3&ndash;4 bedroom home. Price varies based on room count, ceiling height, trim detail, and the amount of prep required.</li>
          <li><strong>Full exterior</strong> ($5,000 &ndash; $12,000): Complete exterior repaint including siding, trim, fascia, and soffits. Includes power washing, scraping, priming, caulking, and two coats of exterior paint.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A well-executed exterior paint job is one of the highest-ROI home improvements you can make. The National Association of Realtors consistently ranks exterior painting among the top projects for cost recovery at resale. In Snohomish County, where curb appeal directly impacts buyer perception, a fresh exterior can add thousands of dollars in perceived value and help your home sell faster.</p>

        <h2>Our Painting Process</h2>
        <p>A paint job is only as good as the preparation behind it. We follow a detailed process that ensures clean results and long-lasting performance:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Color Consultation &amp; Estimate</strong> &mdash; We visit your home, discuss your vision, review the surfaces, and help you select colors and sheens. You receive a detailed written estimate with no surprises.</li>
          <li><strong>Surface Preparation</strong> &mdash; This is where the real work happens. We sand rough areas, scrape peeling paint, fill holes and cracks, caulk gaps around trim and windows, and apply primer where needed. For exteriors, we power-wash the entire surface first.</li>
          <li><strong>Protect Surrounding Surfaces</strong> &mdash; We mask off trim, cover floors with drop cloths, protect fixtures and hardware, and tape clean lines at transitions. Your furniture, carpets, and landscaping are fully protected.</li>
          <li><strong>Paint Application</strong> &mdash; Two full coats of premium paint applied with brushes, rollers, or sprayers depending on the surface. We back-brush all sprayed areas for proper adhesion and use the right application method for each surface type.</li>
          <li><strong>Detail Work &amp; Touch-Ups</strong> &mdash; We cut in around fixtures, outlets, and trim with precision. All edges are clean and straight. Any spots that need attention get touched up before we consider the room complete.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Inspection &amp; Cleanup</strong> &mdash; We walk the entire project with you, check every surface under good lighting, and address any punch-list items. All tape, drop cloths, and materials are removed. We leave your home cleaner than we found it.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does a Painting Project Take?</h2>
        <p>Painting timelines depend on the scope of the project and the amount of prep work required. Here is what to expect for typical projects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Single room: 1&ndash;2 days</li>
          <li>Full interior (3&ndash;4 bedroom home): 1&ndash;2 weeks</li>
          <li>Full exterior: 1&ndash;2 weeks (weather dependent)</li>
          <li>Cabinet painting: 1&ndash;2 weeks (includes cure time between coats)</li>
          <li>Deck staining: 1&ndash;3 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Exterior painting in the Pacific Northwest is weather dependent. We schedule exterior work during dry stretches and monitor forecasts closely. Paint needs to be applied when temperatures are above 50&deg;F and rain is not expected within 4 to 6 hours. We plan around the weather so you get a finish that adheres properly and lasts as long as it should.</p>

        <h2>Permits for Painting in Everett</h2>
        <p>Painting alone does not typically require a building permit in the City of Everett or Snohomish County. However, there are a few situations where permits or approvals may come into play:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Homes in historic districts may require approval for exterior color changes</li>
          <li>HOA-governed communities may have color restrictions and review processes</li>
          <li>Commercial properties may require permits for scaffolding or lane closures</li>
          <li>Lead paint abatement (in homes built before 1978) must follow EPA RRP rules and may require certification</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For residential painting projects, you can typically move forward without any permits. If your project involves drywall repair, electrical updates, or structural work in addition to painting, those components may require separate permits. We advise you on what is needed during your estimate.</p>
