        <h2>The Details That Make a Home Feel Finished</h2>
        <p>Custom carpentry is what separates a house from a home. It is the crown molding that draws the eye upward, the built-in bookshelves that turn a blank wall into a library, the wainscoting that adds depth and character to a hallway, and the custom mantel that becomes the focal point of the living room. These are the details that production builders skip and that homeowners notice every single day.</p>
        <p>NW General Contractor provides custom carpentry and finish work for homeowners throughout Everett and Snohomish County. Whether you are adding architectural details to a new construction home, restoring the character of a craftsman bungalow, or completing a remodel with high-quality trim and built-ins, our carpenters deliver precise, lasting work that transforms the feel of your interior spaces.</p>

        <h2>Our Custom Carpentry Services</h2>

        <h3>Built-In Shelving and Bookcases</h3>
        <p>Built-in shelving transforms unused wall space into functional storage and display areas. Unlike freestanding bookcases, built-ins are integrated into the wall, creating a seamless, architectural look that adds both character and value to your home.</p>
        <p>We design and build built-in bookshelves, entertainment centers, window seats with storage, mudroom cubbies, and home office cabinetry. Each unit is custom-sized to fit your space exactly, with adjustable shelves, cabinet doors where you want them, and interior lighting options. We build in paint-grade materials (poplar, MDF) for painted finishes, or in stain-grade hardwoods (alder, maple, oak, walnut) when you want the warmth of natural wood.</p>

        <h3>Crown Molding</h3>
        <p>Crown molding is one of the most cost-effective ways to add a finished, high-end feel to any room. It bridges the transition between walls and ceilings, creating a visual frame that makes rooms feel more refined and intentionally designed.</p>
        <p>We install crown molding in a range of profiles and sizes, from subtle 3-inch cove molding to elaborate multi-piece build-ups that combine multiple profiles for a dramatic effect. Profile options include traditional ogee, colonial, dentil, egg-and-dart, and clean contemporary lines. For rooms with standard 8-foot ceilings, we typically recommend 3.5 to 5.25-inch profiles. Rooms with 9-foot or taller ceilings can support larger, more detailed profiles that match the scale of the space.</p>
        <p>Precise miters and coping at inside corners are essential for a professional result. Our carpenters have the experience and tools to handle the irregular corners and out-of-plumb walls that are common in both older and newer homes in Snohomish County.</p>

        <h3>Wainscoting and Wall Paneling</h3>
        <p>Wainscoting adds texture, depth, and visual interest to walls, and it serves the practical purpose of protecting lower wall surfaces from scuffs and damage in high-traffic areas. We install several styles of wainscoting:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Raised panel</strong> &mdash; Traditional raised panels framed by stiles and rails. This is the classic wainscoting style found in formal dining rooms, entryways, and hallways.</li>
          <li><strong>Flat panel (recessed panel)</strong> &mdash; A more contemporary take on traditional wainscoting, with flat panels set into the frame. Clean and versatile.</li>
          <li><strong>Beadboard</strong> &mdash; Narrow vertical planks with a distinctive bead groove between each board. Common in cottage, farmhouse, and coastal styles. Works well in bathrooms, laundry rooms, and kitchens.</li>
          <li><strong>Board and batten</strong> &mdash; Vertical battens applied over flat boards, creating a simple, rhythmic pattern. Popular in modern farmhouse and transitional interiors.</li>
          <li><strong>Shiplap</strong> &mdash; Horizontal boards with a subtle overlap or gap between them. A versatile option that works on accent walls, fireplace surrounds, and full-room applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Standard wainscoting height is one-third of the wall (32 to 36 inches), but we adjust the height to suit the proportions of your room. In rooms with tall ceilings, taller wainscoting (48 to 60 inches) can create a more dramatic effect.</p>

        <h3>Custom Closets</h3>
        <p>A custom closet system maximizes every inch of storage space and makes your morning routine more efficient. Unlike wire shelving or modular kits, our custom closets are built to the exact dimensions of your space and designed around your specific wardrobe and storage needs.</p>
        <p>Features we commonly include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Double-hang rods for shirts and folded pants</li>
          <li>Long-hang sections for dresses and coats</li>
          <li>Built-in drawers for folded items</li>
          <li>Adjustable shelving for shoes, bags, and accessories</li>
          <li>Pull-out hampers and laundry bins</li>
          <li>Jewelry trays and accessory organizers</li>
          <li>LED closet lighting (motion-activated or switched)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We build closet systems in melamine, paint-grade wood, or stain-grade hardwood, depending on your preferences and budget. Walk-in closets, reach-in closets, linen closets, and pantry organizers are all within our scope.</p>

        <h3>Fireplace Mantels and Surrounds</h3>
        <p>The fireplace is often the focal point of the living room, and the mantel and surround define its character. We build custom mantels in a range of styles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Traditional</strong> &mdash; Pilasters, a decorative frieze, and a mantel shelf with crown molding. Built from poplar (painted) or hardwood (stained).</li>
          <li><strong>Craftsman</strong> &mdash; Clean lines, natural wood, and simple brackets. Quarter-sawn white oak or Douglas fir for an authentic Snohomish County craftsman look.</li>
          <li><strong>Modern</strong> &mdash; Floating mantel shelves in walnut, reclaimed wood, or painted wood. Minimal trim for a clean, contemporary look.</li>
          <li><strong>Rustic</strong> &mdash; Reclaimed barn wood or hand-hewn timber mantels with natural character, knots, and texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also build full fireplace surrounds using wood paneling, stone veneer, tile, or combinations of materials. The surround frames the firebox and creates a visual anchor for the room.</p>

        <h3>Interior Trim and Door Installation</h3>
        <p>Trim work is the connective tissue of your home's interior design. It includes baseboards, door casings, window casings, chair rail, and any other profiles that frame openings and transitions. Consistent, well-installed trim makes every room feel polished and complete.</p>
        <p>We install trim in a range of profiles to match your home's style:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Colonial / traditional</strong> &mdash; Rounded profiles with ogee curves, typically 3.25 to 5.25 inches for baseboards and 2.25 to 3.5 inches for casings.</li>
          <li><strong>Craftsman</strong> &mdash; Flat, square-edged profiles with clean lines. Wide baseboards (5.25 to 7.25 inches) and thick casings create the substantial look characteristic of the style.</li>
          <li><strong>Modern / contemporary</strong> &mdash; Narrow, flat profiles or shadow-gap details for a minimalist look.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also install interior doors, including pre-hung doors, slab doors in existing frames, pocket doors, barn doors, and French doors. Door style should complement the trim profile and the overall interior design.</p>

        <h3>Staircases and Railings</h3>
        <p>A staircase is one of the most visible architectural features in a two-story home. We build and remodel staircases including new treads and risers, newel posts, balusters, handrails, and landing trim. Options range from traditional wood balusters to modern cable rail, wrought iron, and glass panel systems.</p>
        <p>Stair remodeling can dramatically change the feel of an entryway or main living area. Replacing carpeted stairs with hardwood treads and painted risers is one of the most popular finish carpentry projects we perform. We ensure proper tread depth, riser height, and handrail dimensions that meet code requirements while achieving the aesthetic you want.</p>

        <h3>Architectural Details</h3>
        <p>Beyond the common categories, we build and install a wide range of custom carpentry elements that add character and craftsmanship to your home:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Coffered ceilings and ceiling beams (real wood or decorative hollow beams)</li>
          <li>Arched doorways and pass-throughs</li>
          <li>Window seats and bay window framing</li>
          <li>Plate rails and picture ledges</li>
          <li>Decorative brackets and corbels</li>
          <li>Custom cabinet doors and drawer fronts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Process for Custom Carpentry</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Consultation</strong> &mdash; We visit your home, discuss your vision, take measurements, and review style and material options.</li>
          <li><strong>Design &amp; Estimate</strong> &mdash; We provide a detailed written estimate with material specifications, dimensions, and finish details.</li>
          <li><strong>Material Sourcing</strong> &mdash; We source lumber, millwork, and hardware from local suppliers and specialty millwork shops.</li>
          <li><strong>Fabrication &amp; Installation</strong> &mdash; Much of the work is done on-site to ensure precise fits. Larger built-ins may be partially fabricated in a shop and assembled on-site.</li>
          <li><strong>Finishing</strong> &mdash; Sanding, filling, caulking, priming, and painting or staining. We leave your home clean and the work ready to enjoy.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Materials and Wood Species</h2>
        <p>The right wood species depends on whether the finished piece will be painted or stained, the level of durability needed, and your budget:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Paint-grade poplar</strong> &mdash; Smooth, stable, and affordable. The standard choice for painted trim, built-ins, and molding.</li>
          <li><strong>MDF (medium-density fiberboard)</strong> &mdash; Smooth, consistent, and cost-effective for painted applications. Works well for flat-panel wainscoting and simple trim profiles.</li>
          <li><strong>Alder</strong> &mdash; A Pacific Northwest hardwood with a warm, reddish tone. Popular for stain-grade trim and cabinetry in craftsman and rustic styles.</li>
          <li><strong>Maple</strong> &mdash; Hard, smooth, and light in color. Takes stain and paint well. Good for built-ins and closet systems.</li>
          <li><strong>White oak</strong> &mdash; Durable and versatile with a prominent grain pattern. A premium choice for stain-grade trim, mantels, and built-ins.</li>
          <li><strong>Walnut</strong> &mdash; Rich, dark, and striking. A high-end choice for floating mantels, accent shelves, and feature pieces.</li>
          <li><strong>Douglas fir</strong> &mdash; The traditional choice for craftsman homes in the Pacific Northwest. Tight, straight grain with a warm honey tone.</li>
        </ul>
