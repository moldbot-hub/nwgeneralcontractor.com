        <h2>Better Windows and Doors Make a Better Home</h2>
        <p>Your windows and doors do more than let in light and air. They are the barrier between your home and the Pacific Northwest elements &mdash; the rain, the wind, the cold winter nights, and the occasional summer heat. When that barrier is compromised by age, seal failure, or poor insulation, you feel it in drafty rooms, foggy glass, higher energy bills, and noise that should not make it inside.</p>
        <p>At NW General Contractor, we handle window and door replacement projects of every size throughout Everett and Snohomish County. Whether you need a single window replaced, a full-house window upgrade, or a new entry door that transforms your curb appeal, our team manages the entire process from product selection to final trim. We install energy-efficient products from trusted manufacturers and back every installation with our workmanship guarantee.</p>

        <h2>Our Window &amp; Door Services</h2>
        <p>Windows and doors come in a wide range of styles, materials, and configurations. We help you choose the right products for your home's architecture, your performance requirements, and your budget. Here is what we install:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Window Replacement</strong> &mdash; Full-frame and insert (pocket) replacement for double-hung, casement, slider, awning, and picture windows. We remove the old unit, inspect the rough opening for water damage, insulate, flash, and install the new window to manufacturer specifications.</li>
          <li><strong>Entry Door Installation</strong> &mdash; Front doors, side entry doors, and back doors in fiberglass, steel, and wood. A new entry door is one of the highest-ROI home improvements you can make &mdash; it changes the entire look of your home from the street.</li>
          <li><strong>Sliding Glass Doors</strong> &mdash; Modern sliding patio doors with multi-point locking, Low-E glass, and smooth gliding operation. We replace old, drafty sliders with energy-efficient units that open and close effortlessly.</li>
          <li><strong>French Doors</strong> &mdash; Interior and exterior French doors that add elegance and natural light. Available in wood, fiberglass, and vinyl with a variety of glass and grille options.</li>
          <li><strong>Patio Doors</strong> &mdash; Hinged, sliding, and folding patio door systems that connect your indoor and outdoor living spaces. Multi-panel folding doors create dramatic openings for entertaining and enjoying Pacific Northwest summers.</li>
          <li><strong>Storm Windows</strong> &mdash; Interior and exterior storm windows that add an extra layer of insulation over existing windows. A cost-effective option for homeowners who want to improve efficiency without full replacement.</li>
          <li><strong>Bay &amp; Bow Windows</strong> &mdash; Projecting window configurations that create additional interior space and dramatic architectural interest. Bay windows combine a picture window with two angled side units. Bow windows use four or more units in a gentle curve.</li>
          <li><strong>Window Trim &amp; Casing</strong> &mdash; Interior and exterior trim, casing, and sill work to complete the finished look around new or existing windows. We match existing profiles or install new trim packages for a clean, consistent appearance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Window Materials: Choosing the Right Frame and Glass</h2>
        <p>The frame material and glass package you choose determine how your windows perform for the next 20 to 30 years. Here is how the most popular options compare for Pacific Northwest homes.</p>
        <p><strong>Vinyl windows</strong> are the most popular choice in Snohomish County and for good reason. They offer excellent energy efficiency, resist moisture and rot without painting or staining, and deliver strong performance at a mid-range price point. Modern vinyl frames are reinforced with steel or composite for structural rigidity and are available in a range of interior and exterior colors. For most homes in Everett, vinyl is the best balance of performance, aesthetics, and value.</p>
        <p><strong>Fiberglass windows</strong> are the premium option for homeowners who want maximum durability and the longest lifespan. Fiberglass is stronger than vinyl, expands and contracts less with temperature changes, and can be painted if you want to change colors down the road. Fiberglass frames are thinner than vinyl, which means more glass area and more light. Brands like Marvin, Pella, and Andersen offer fiberglass lines that are built to last 30 years or more.</p>
        <p><strong>Wood windows</strong> offer the best natural insulation and the classic aesthetic that many older Everett homes were built with. Wood frames can be stained or painted to match any style. The tradeoff is maintenance &mdash; wood requires periodic painting or staining to prevent moisture damage, which is a real consideration in the Pacific Northwest. Many manufacturers now offer wood interiors with aluminum or fiberglass cladding on the exterior to reduce maintenance while preserving the interior warmth of real wood. <strong>Low-E glass coatings</strong>, <strong>argon or krypton gas fills</strong>, and the choice between <strong>double-pane and triple-pane</strong> construction also significantly affect energy performance. In our climate, double-pane Low-E with argon fill meets Energy Star requirements and delivers excellent performance for most homes. Triple-pane is worth the upgrade for north-facing walls, bedrooms on busy streets, or homeowners who want the highest possible insulation value.</p>

        <h2>What Does Window and Door Replacement Cost in Everett?</h2>
        <p>Window and door costs depend on the product selected, the number of units, the type of installation (full-frame vs. insert), and whether exterior trim or siding repairs are needed. Here are the general ranges we see in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Per window replacement</strong> ($400 &ndash; $1,200 installed): Standard vinyl double-hung or slider window, insert installation. Price varies based on size, glass package, and accessibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Full house replacement</strong> (10&ndash;15 windows, $8,000 &ndash; $18,000): Complete window upgrade with consistent style throughout. Volume pricing typically reduces the per-window cost. Includes all removal, installation, insulation, and interior trim.</li>
          <li><strong>Premium entry door</strong> ($2,000 &ndash; $5,000): Fiberglass or steel entry door with sidelights, decorative glass, hardware, and weatherstripping. Includes removal of old door, threshold adjustment, and finish trim.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Window and door replacement consistently ranks among the top home improvement projects for return on investment. The National Association of Realtors reports that vinyl window replacement recoups approximately 67% of the project cost at resale, while a new entry door can recoup over 100%. Beyond resale value, the energy savings, improved comfort, reduced noise, and enhanced curb appeal make windows and doors one of the smartest upgrades you can make for a Pacific Northwest home.</p>

        <h2>Our Window &amp; Door Replacement Process</h2>
        <p>Proper window and door installation is critical. A high-quality window installed poorly will leak, draft, and fail prematurely. We follow a detailed process to ensure every unit is installed correctly. Here is what to expect:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Assessment &amp; Measurement</strong> &mdash; We inspect your existing windows and doors, evaluate the condition of the frames and surrounding structure, and take precise measurements for ordering. We also discuss your priorities: energy savings, noise reduction, style, or all of the above. This visit is free and comes with no obligation.</li>
          <li><strong>Product Selection</strong> &mdash; We help you choose the right frame material, glass package, style, and hardware for your home and budget. We work with multiple manufacturers so you are not limited to a single product line.</li>
          <li><strong>Order &amp; Scheduling</strong> &mdash; Custom and special-order windows typically take 3 to 6 weeks for manufacturing. We confirm your installation dates once the products are in transit and coordinate the schedule to minimize disruption.</li>
          <li><strong>Removal of Old Windows/Doors</strong> &mdash; We carefully remove the existing units and inspect the rough opening for water damage, rot, or structural issues. Any problems found are repaired before the new unit goes in.</li>
          <li><strong>Installation</strong> &mdash; New windows and doors are set level, plumb, and square. We flash and seal the exterior with proper waterproofing membrane and caulk to prevent water intrusion &mdash; the most critical step in the Pacific Northwest. Insulation is installed around the frame to eliminate air gaps.</li>
          <li><strong>Insulate &amp; Seal</strong> &mdash; Low-expansion foam insulation fills the gap between the window frame and the rough opening. Exterior caulk and flashing tape create a weathertight seal. Interior vapor management ensures moisture does not get trapped in the wall cavity.</li>
          <li><strong>Trim &amp; Finish</strong> &mdash; Interior casing, extension jambs, and sill work are installed or restored. Exterior trim, j-channel, or capping is applied to integrate the new window with your siding. Everything is caulked, painted, or stained to match.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Inspection</strong> &mdash; We operate every window and door to confirm smooth function, verify proper locking, check for air leaks, and clean all glass. We walk the project with you and address any items before we call it complete.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does Window and Door Replacement Take?</h2>
        <p>Once products arrive, the installation itself moves quickly. The longest part of the process is typically the manufacturing lead time for custom or special-order units. Here is a general breakdown:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Single window replacement: 2&ndash;4 hours per window</li>
          <li>Full house (10&ndash;15 windows): 3&ndash;5 days of installation</li>
          <li>Entry door replacement: 1 day (4&ndash;8 hours)</li>
          <li>Sliding or French door: 1 day per unit</li>
          <li>Bay or bow window: 1&ndash;2 days depending on structural requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We schedule window replacements to minimize the time any opening is exposed. Each window is removed and replaced in sequence so your home is never left with an open hole overnight. For multi-day projects, we work floor by floor or section by section. Manufacturing lead times range from 1 to 6 weeks depending on the manufacturer and product line. We provide a complete timeline at the start of every project.</p>

        <h2>Permits for Window and Door Replacement in Everett</h2>
        <p>Window and door replacement permitting depends on the scope of work. In the City of Everett and Snohomish County, permits are generally required when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changing the size of a window or door opening (enlarging or reducing the rough opening)</li>
          <li>Adding a new window or door where one did not exist before (cutting into a wall)</li>
          <li>Structural modifications such as adding or modifying headers above openings</li>
          <li>Egress window installations in bedrooms that do not currently meet code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Same-size replacement windows and doors &mdash; where the new unit fits into the existing opening without structural changes &mdash; typically do not require a permit. This covers the majority of window replacement projects. When permits are required, we handle the full application and inspection process as part of our service.</p>

        <h2>Why Everett Homeowners Choose NW General Contractor</h2>
        <p>Window and door replacement is a project where the installation matters as much as the product. We have seen expensive windows fail within a few years because they were not flashed properly, not insulated correctly, or not shimmed to be level and square. In the Pacific Northwest, where wind-driven rain is a constant reality, waterproofing details around windows and doors are not optional &mdash; they are the difference between a window that performs and one that leaks into your wall cavity.</p>
        <p>We are licensed, bonded, and insured in Washington state. We follow manufacturer installation specifications and local building code requirements on every project. We work with multiple window and door brands so we can recommend the right product for your home rather than selling you whatever one company makes. Whether you are replacing a single drafty window or upgrading every opening in your house, we deliver quality installation, honest pricing, and results you can feel the next time the wind blows.</p>
