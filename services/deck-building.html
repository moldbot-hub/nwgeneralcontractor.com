        <h2>Custom Decks Built for the Pacific Northwest</h2>
        <p>A well-built deck extends your living space outdoors and becomes one of the most-used areas of your home during the warmer months. In the Pacific Northwest, where we enjoy long summer evenings and mild shoulder seasons, a deck is not just an amenity; it is a central part of how families spend time at home. But building a deck in this climate also means building for rain, moisture, and the occasional windstorm. That requires proper materials, engineering, and construction techniques.</p>
        <p>NW General Contractor designs and builds custom decks throughout Everett and Snohomish County. Whether you want a low-maintenance composite deck for entertaining, a covered patio for year-round use, or a multi-level cedar deck with built-in seating and lighting, we handle every phase from design through completion.</p>

        <h2>Wood vs. Composite Decking: Making the Right Choice</h2>
        <p>The most important decision in any deck project is the decking material. Each option has distinct advantages, and the right choice depends on your budget, maintenance preferences, and aesthetic goals.</p>

        <h3>Composite Decking (Trex, TimberTech, Fiberon)</h3>
        <p>Composite decking is made from a blend of wood fibers and plastic polymers, creating a material that resists moisture, rot, insects, and UV fading. It is the most popular choice among our Everett clients for good reason:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Low maintenance</strong> &mdash; No staining, sealing, or painting required. Occasional cleaning with soap and water is all that is needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Moisture resistance</strong> &mdash; Composite boards do not absorb water, which means no swelling, warping, or splitting in the wet PNW climate.</li>
          <li><strong>Longevity</strong> &mdash; Premium composite products carry 25-year or lifetime warranties against structural defects and fading.</li>
          <li><strong>Consistent appearance</strong> &mdash; Modern composite decking closely mimics the look of natural wood, with realistic grain patterns and color variation. Brands like Trex Transcend, TimberTech Advanced PVC, and Fiberon Concordia offer premium aesthetics.</li>
          <li><strong>Color options</strong> &mdash; Composite comes in a wide range of colors, from traditional wood tones to grays and darker shades that suit modern home designs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The primary trade-off is cost. Composite decking material costs more than wood, typically $8 to $14 per square foot for the boards alone, compared to $3 to $6 for pressure-treated lumber. However, when you factor in the cost of staining and maintaining a wood deck over 10 to 15 years, composite often breaks even or comes out ahead.</p>

        <h3>Wood Decking (Cedar and Pressure-Treated)</h3>
        <p><strong>Western red cedar</strong> is a traditional PNW decking choice. It is naturally resistant to rot and insects, has a warm reddish-brown color, and is lighter in weight than pressure-treated lumber. Cedar requires annual or biannual cleaning and sealing to maintain its appearance and longevity. Left untreated, it will weather to a silver-gray over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Pressure-treated lumber</strong> is the most affordable decking option. It is southern pine that has been chemically treated to resist rot and insect damage. Pressure-treated decks need to be stained and sealed after an initial drying period and maintained every 1 to 2 years. It is a practical choice for homeowners who prefer a lower upfront cost and do not mind the regular maintenance.</p>

        <h2>Deck Features and Add-Ons</h2>
        <p>Beyond the decking surface itself, we build a range of features that enhance the function and appearance of your outdoor space:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Covered patios and roofs</strong> &mdash; A solid roof structure over part or all of the deck allows year-round use, even during the rainy months. We build patio covers with exposed beams, tongue-and-groove ceilings, and integrated gutters for a clean, finished look.</li>
          <li><strong>Pergolas</strong> &mdash; An open-beam structure that provides partial shade and defines the outdoor space. Pergolas work well with climbing plants and can be fitted with retractable shade fabric or louvered panels.</li>
          <li><strong>Railings</strong> &mdash; Aluminum, cable, glass panel, composite, and traditional wood railings. Railing style has a major impact on the deck's appearance and views. Cable railings and glass panels maintain sightlines while meeting code requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Stairs and multi-level designs</strong> &mdash; For sloped lots or elevated decks, we build stairs with proper rise and run, code-compliant handrails, and landings. Multi-level decks create distinct zones for dining, lounging, and cooking.</li>
          <li><strong>Built-in seating and planters</strong> &mdash; Integrated benches along the perimeter, planter boxes at corners, and storage benches that double as seating.</li>
          <li><strong>Outdoor lighting</strong> &mdash; Low-voltage LED post caps, stair lights, under-rail lighting, and recessed deck lights. Outdoor lighting extends the usability of your deck into the evening and adds safety on stairs and transitions.</li>
          <li><strong>Outdoor kitchens and grilling stations</strong> &mdash; Built-in grill surrounds, countertop space, storage, and utility connections for gas and water.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deck Building Costs in Everett</h2>
        <p>Deck construction costs depend on the materials, size, height, and complexity of the design. Here are the typical ranges for projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pressure-treated wood deck (200-300 sq ft)</strong>: $15,000 &ndash; $20,000</li>
          <li><strong>Cedar deck (200-300 sq ft)</strong>: $18,000 &ndash; $24,000</li>
          <li><strong>Composite deck (200-300 sq ft)</strong>: $22,000 &ndash; $30,000</li>
          <li><strong>Covered patio or deck with roof (add-on)</strong>: $8,000 &ndash; $20,000</li>
          <li><strong>Pergola (add-on)</strong>: $5,000 &ndash; $12,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These prices include footings, framing (pressure-treated substructure regardless of decking material), decking, railings, stairs, and labor. Covered structures, built-in features, and premium railing systems add to the cost. We provide a detailed, itemized estimate so you know exactly what is included before construction begins.</p>

        <h2>Building for PNW Weather</h2>
        <p>Everett receives approximately 37 inches of rain per year, and the surrounding Snohomish County area sees even more in higher elevations. Building a deck that will hold up in this climate requires specific construction practices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Proper ledger board attachment</strong> &mdash; The ledger board connects the deck to the house and is the most common failure point in deck construction. We use through-bolts or structural screws with proper flashing to create a waterproof connection that prevents rot at the house wall.</li>
          <li><strong>Adequate drainage and ventilation</strong> &mdash; Deck boards must have proper spacing for water drainage. The area beneath the deck needs adequate airflow to prevent moisture buildup. We also install ground cover fabric to suppress vegetation growth under the deck.</li>
          <li><strong>Concrete footings below frost line</strong> &mdash; Footings in Snohomish County must extend below the frost line (typically 12 inches) and be sized appropriately for the load they carry. We use concrete pier footings with post bases that keep the posts above the concrete to prevent moisture wicking.</li>
          <li><strong>Hot-dipped galvanized or stainless steel hardware</strong> &mdash; All joist hangers, post bases, bolts, and screws must be rated for ground contact and moisture exposure. We use Simpson Strong-Tie hardware throughout, with hot-dipped galvanized or stainless steel fasteners that will not corrode in the wet climate.</li>
          <li><strong>Pressure-treated substructure</strong> &mdash; Regardless of the decking material (composite, cedar, or PT), the structural framing beneath the deck is always pressure-treated lumber rated for ground contact where applicable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Permits for Deck Building in Everett</h2>
        <p>Most decks in Everett and Snohomish County require a building permit. A permit is generally required when the deck is more than 30 inches above grade at any point, when it is attached to the house, or when it includes a roof or cover structure. The permit process includes plan submittal, review, and inspections at the footing and framing stages.</p>
        <p>Ground-level decks (less than 30 inches above grade and freestanding) may be exempt from permits in some jurisdictions, but we recommend confirming with the local building department before starting work. We handle all permit applications and inspections as part of our service.</p>

        <h2>Our Deck Building Process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Free Consultation</strong> &mdash; We visit your property, discuss your vision, review the site conditions, and talk through material options and budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Design &amp; Estimate</strong> &mdash; We create a deck plan with dimensions, material specifications, and a detailed written estimate.</li>
          <li><strong>Permits</strong> &mdash; We submit the permit application and handle plan review and any revisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Footings &amp; Framing</strong> &mdash; Concrete footings are poured and inspected. Posts, beams, and joists are installed with proper spacing and hardware.</li>
          <li><strong>Decking &amp; Railings</strong> &mdash; Deck boards are installed with proper fastening and spacing. Railings, stairs, and any built-in features follow.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Details</strong> &mdash; Lighting, trim, and any finishing touches. Final inspection and walkthrough with you.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does Deck Construction Take?</h2>
        <p>Most deck projects in Everett take 1 to 3 weeks for construction. A straightforward ground-level deck can often be completed in 5 to 7 working days. Larger decks with multiple levels, stairs, and covered sections take 2 to 3 weeks. Covered patios with roofing can add another week. Permit processing typically takes 2 to 4 weeks before construction begins.</p>
