        <h2>A Well-Built Fence Defines Your Property and Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your fence is one of the first things people notice about your property. It sets boundaries, provides privacy, keeps children and pets safe, and adds real curb appeal to your home. In Snohomish County, where lot sizes range from compact urban parcels to multi-acre properties, the right fence makes a meaningful difference in how you use and enjoy your outdoor space.</p>
        <p>At NW General Contractor, we build custom fences throughout Everett and Snohomish County. Whether you need a classic cedar privacy fence for your backyard, a durable vinyl perimeter for low maintenance, or a functional chain link enclosure for a specific purpose, we handle the full project from property assessment through final inspection. Every fence we build is engineered for the Pacific Northwest climate and installed to last.</p>

        <h2>Our Fencing Services</h2>
        <p>We install and repair all major fence types used in residential and light commercial applications. Here is what we offer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cedar Privacy Fences</strong> &mdash; The classic Pacific Northwest choice. Western red cedar is naturally rot-resistant, beautiful, and ages gracefully to a silver-gray patina. We build board-on-board, dog-ear, flat-top, and lattice-top privacy styles in heights up to 8 feet.</li>
          <li><strong>Vinyl Fencing</strong> &mdash; Zero maintenance, weather-resistant, and available in a range of styles including privacy, semi-privacy, picket, and ranch rail. Vinyl will not rot, warp, or need painting, and most products carry a 20-year or lifetime warranty.</li>
          <li><strong>Chain Link Fencing</strong> &mdash; Affordable, functional, and durable. Ideal for dog runs, property boundaries, garden enclosures, and utility areas. Available in galvanized or vinyl-coated finishes in green, black, or brown.</li>
          <li><strong>Ornamental Iron &amp; Aluminum</strong> &mdash; Elegant fencing for front yards, pool enclosures, and decorative boundaries. Aluminum is rust-free and low-maintenance while providing the classic look of wrought iron at a lower cost.</li>
          <li><strong>Fence Repair</strong> &mdash; Storm damage, rot, leaning posts, broken rails, and sagging gates. We repair and reinforce existing fences to extend their lifespan and restore their function without a full replacement when possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Gate Installation</strong> &mdash; Single pedestrian gates, double drive gates, sliding gates, and self-closing pool gates. We build custom gates that match your fence style and include quality hardware rated for daily use.</li>
          <li><strong>Post Replacement</strong> &mdash; Rotted or broken posts are the most common fence failure point. We replace individual posts without removing the entire fence, using concrete footings and proper drainage to prevent future rot.</li>
          <li><strong>Fence Staining &amp; Sealing</strong> &mdash; Protect your cedar fence investment with professional staining and sealing. We clean the wood, apply UV-resistant stain, and seal against moisture to keep your fence looking great and lasting longer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fence Materials: Choosing the Right Option for Your Property</h2>
        <p><strong>Western red cedar</strong> is the most popular fence material in the Pacific Northwest for good reason. It is naturally resistant to rot, decay, and insect damage without chemical treatment. Cedar is dimensionally stable, meaning it resists warping and splitting better than other softwoods. It accepts stain beautifully and ages to an attractive silver-gray if left untreated. For homeowners who want a warm, natural look that fits the PNW aesthetic, cedar is the gold standard. We source tight-knot and clear grades depending on your budget and visual preference.</p>
        <p><strong>Vinyl fencing</strong> is the best choice for homeowners who want a fence they can truly set and forget. Vinyl does not rot, crack, peel, or fade. It never needs painting or staining. Modern vinyl products have come a long way in terms of aesthetics and are available in wood-grain textures that convincingly mimic the look of painted wood. The initial cost is higher than cedar, but the lifetime cost is lower because there is zero maintenance.</p>
        <p><strong>Chain link</strong> remains the most affordable fencing option per linear foot. It is extremely durable, requires almost no maintenance, and provides reliable containment for pets and property security. Vinyl-coated chain link in black or green blends into the landscape more naturally than bare galvanized steel. For utility fencing, dog runs, and large property perimeters, chain link delivers the best value.</p>

        <h2>What Does a Fence Cost in Everett?</h2>
        <p>Fence costs are typically quoted per linear foot and vary based on material, height, terrain, and the number of gates. Here are the general ranges for residential fence installation in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chain link</strong> ($15 &ndash; $25 per linear foot): Includes posts, top rail, fabric, and hardware. Vinyl-coated options are at the higher end of this range.</li>
          <li><strong>Cedar privacy</strong> ($30 &ndash; $50 per linear foot): Includes pressure-treated posts, cedar rails, cedar pickets or boards, concrete footings, and standard hardware. Height, grade of cedar, and fence style affect the final price.</li>
          <li><strong>Vinyl</strong> ($25 &ndash; $45 per linear foot): Includes posts, rails, panels, and hardware. Privacy panels cost more than semi-privacy or picket styles.</li>
          <li><strong>Ornamental aluminum or iron</strong> ($40 &ndash; $70 per linear foot): Includes posts, panels, and hardware. Pool-code-compliant fencing with self-closing gates is at the upper end.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A standard 200-linear-foot cedar privacy fence typically runs between $6,000 and $10,000 installed. Gates add $300 to $1,200 each depending on size and style. We provide detailed written estimates that break down every cost before work begins, so there are no surprises.</p>

        <h2>Our Fence Installation Process</h2>
        <p>A fence that lasts starts with proper planning and installation. Here is how we approach every fence project:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Property Survey &amp; Consultation</strong> &mdash; We visit your property, discuss your goals (privacy, security, aesthetics, pet containment), review the terrain, and identify your property boundaries. If you do not have a recent survey, we strongly recommend one to avoid disputes with neighbors.</li>
          <li><strong>Design &amp; Material Selection</strong> &mdash; We help you choose the right fence type, height, style, and material for your needs and budget. You will receive a detailed proposal with material specifications and a total price.</li>
          <li><strong>Utility Locate</strong> &mdash; Before any digging begins, we call 811 to have underground utilities marked. This is a free service and a legal requirement in Washington state. It protects against hitting gas, water, electric, or fiber optic lines during post hole installation.</li>
          <li><strong>Post Holes &amp; Setting</strong> &mdash; Posts are set in concrete footings at the correct depth and spacing. In the PNW, we pay special attention to drainage around posts to prevent premature rot. Posts are plumbed and leveled before the concrete sets.</li>
          <li><strong>Rail Installation</strong> &mdash; Horizontal rails are attached between posts to create the framework for the fence. We use galvanized or stainless hardware that will not rust or stain the wood over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Picket &amp; Panel Installation</strong> &mdash; Pickets, boards, or panels are attached to the rails. We maintain consistent spacing, level tops, and plumb alignment throughout the entire run of the fence.</li>
          <li><strong>Gate Hanging</strong> &mdash; Gates are hung on heavy-duty hinges with proper clearance and self-closing hardware where required. We adjust latches, stops, and closers for smooth, reliable operation.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Inspection &amp; Cleanup</strong> &mdash; We walk the finished fence with you, check every section for alignment and quality, and clean up all debris and leftover materials from your property.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does Fence Installation Take?</h2>
        <p>Fence installation timelines depend on the total length, terrain complexity, and the number of gates. Here is what to expect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Standard 100&ndash;200 linear foot fence: 3&ndash;5 days</li>
          <li>Complex installations with multiple gates, slopes, or corners: 1&ndash;2 weeks</li>
          <li>Fence repair or partial replacement: 1&ndash;2 days</li>
          <li>Post replacement (individual): Same day</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Weather can affect scheduling, particularly if we need to pour concrete footings during a heavy rain stretch. We schedule work to avoid curing issues and keep you informed of any weather-related adjustments. Material lead times are typically short for cedar and chain link, but vinyl and ornamental fencing may require 1 to 2 weeks for ordering depending on the style selected.</p>

        <h2>Permits for Fence Installation in Everett</h2>
        <p>Fence permit requirements vary by jurisdiction within Snohomish County. Here is what you need to know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fences over 6 feet in height generally require a building permit in the City of Everett and most Snohomish County jurisdictions</li>
          <li>Fences in front yard setback areas may have height restrictions (typically 4 feet maximum)</li>
          <li>Corner lots may have sight-line restrictions near intersections that limit fence height and placement</li>
          <li>Pool fencing must meet specific code requirements including minimum height, gate hardware, and spacing between pickets</li>
          <li>Some neighborhoods with HOAs require architectural review approval before installation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Standard 6-foot backyard privacy fences typically do not require a permit in most Snohomish County jurisdictions, but it is always worth confirming with your local planning department. We verify permit requirements as part of our process and handle any applications on your behalf.</p>

We provide clear, detailed estimates, maintain clean job sites, and communicate throughout the project.
