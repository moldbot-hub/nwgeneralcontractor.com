        <h2>Expand Your Home Instead of Moving</h2>
        <p>When your family outgrows your home, the decision comes down to two options: move to a bigger house or add the space you need to the one you already have. In today's housing market, with high interest rates, limited inventory, and significant transaction costs, building a home addition is often the smarter financial choice. It is also the only option that lets you stay in the neighborhood you love while getting exactly the space you need.</p>
        <p>NW General Contractor builds home additions throughout Everett and Snohomish County. From small bump-outs that add a few feet to a room, to full second-story additions that double your square footage, we handle every aspect of the project: design, engineering, permits, foundation, framing, and finish work.</p>

        <h2>Types of Home Additions We Build</h2>

        <h3>Room Additions</h3>
        <p>A ground-level room addition extends your home's footprint by building a new room onto the existing structure. This is the most common type of addition and works well for adding a primary bedroom suite, a family room, a home office, or an expanded kitchen and dining area.</p>
        <p>Room additions require a new foundation (typically a concrete stem wall or slab), which must be engineered to match or exceed the standards of your existing foundation. The new addition is framed, roofed, and finished to match the existing home in style, materials, and quality. Typical room additions range from 200 to 600 square feet.</p>

        <h3>Bump-Out Additions</h3>
        <p>A bump-out is a smaller addition, usually 2 to 10 feet deep, that extends an existing room. Bump-outs are ideal for expanding a kitchen, adding space to a bathroom, creating a window seat or breakfast nook, or widening a hallway. Because they are smaller in scale, they are generally faster and less expensive than full room additions.</p>
        <p>Bump-outs under a certain size may be supported on cantilevered floor joists rather than a full foundation, which reduces cost. Larger bump-outs require foundation work similar to a full room addition. We assess the best structural approach based on the size and location of the bump-out.</p>

        <h3>Second-Story Additions</h3>
        <p>A second-story addition adds an entirely new level to a single-story home. This is the most effective way to add significant square footage without expanding your home's footprint, making it ideal for properties with limited lot size or setback constraints.</p>
        <p>Second-story additions are complex projects that require structural engineering analysis of the existing foundation and framing to ensure they can support the additional load. In some cases, foundation reinforcement or post-and-beam upgrades are needed. The existing roof is removed, new walls and floor framing are built, and a new roof is constructed.</p>
        <p>Despite the complexity, a second-story addition is often the best value in terms of cost per square foot because it leverages your existing foundation and lot coverage. Many Everett homeowners with 1950s and 1960s ramblers use this approach to create a 3-or 4-bedroom home from a modest single-story structure.</p>

        <h3>Sunrooms and Four-Season Rooms</h3>
        <p>A sunroom adds a light-filled living space that connects your home to the outdoors. In the Pacific Northwest, a properly insulated and heated four-season room can be used year-round, providing a comfortable space even during the rainy months. Sunrooms typically feature large windows or floor-to-ceiling glass on two or three sides, a solid roof, and climate-controlled comfort.</p>
        <p>Unlike a screened porch or covered patio, a true four-season sunroom is built to the same insulation and energy code standards as the rest of your home. This means insulated walls and roof, double or triple-pane windows, and a heating system (radiant floor, mini-split, or ductwork extension).</p>

        <h2>Home Addition Costs in Everett</h2>
        <p>The cost of a home addition depends on the type, size, and complexity of the project. Here are the typical ranges we see in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bump-out addition (50-150 sq ft)</strong>: $150 &ndash; $250/sq ft ($7,500 &ndash; $37,500)</li>
          <li><strong>Ground-floor room addition (200-600 sq ft)</strong>: $200 &ndash; $300/sq ft ($40,000 &ndash; $180,000)</li>
          <li><strong>Second-story addition (400-1,000 sq ft)</strong>: $250 &ndash; $350/sq ft ($100,000 &ndash; $350,000)</li>
          <li><strong>Sunroom / four-season room (150-300 sq ft)</strong>: $175 &ndash; $275/sq ft ($26,250 &ndash; $82,500)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These ranges include design, permitting, foundation, framing, roofing, exterior finish, insulation, drywall, flooring, electrical, plumbing (if applicable), and interior finish. Costs at the higher end reflect additions that include bathrooms, kitchenettes, or premium finishes.</p>

        <h2>Matching the Existing Architecture</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest concerns homeowners have about building an addition is whether it will look like it was tacked on as an afterthought. A well-designed addition should be indistinguishable from the original house. This requires careful attention to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Roofline</strong> &mdash; The pitch, style, and material of the new roof must match or complement the existing roof. Ridge height, eave depth, and fascia details all need to align.</li>
          <li><strong>Siding</strong> &mdash; We source matching siding material, or, when an exact match is unavailable, we use a complementary material that integrates naturally.</li>
          <li><strong>Windows</strong> &mdash; Window style, size, and trim should be consistent with the existing home. This includes matching mullion patterns, trim profiles, and glass type.</li>
          <li><strong>Interior transitions</strong> &mdash; Flooring, trim profiles, ceiling heights, and door styles should flow seamlessly from the existing home into the addition. Abrupt transitions are the telltale sign of a poorly planned addition.</li>
          <li><strong>Foundation height</strong> &mdash; The new foundation must bring the floor of the addition to the exact same level as the existing floor, which requires precise measurement and construction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Foundation Work for Home Additions</h2>
        <p>The foundation is the most critical element of any home addition. In Snohomish County, the most common foundation types for additions are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Concrete stem wall with crawl space</strong> &mdash; Matches the construction of most existing homes in the area and provides access for plumbing and HVAC.</li>
          <li><strong>Concrete slab on grade</strong> &mdash; Used when the existing home sits on a slab or when the addition is at grade level. Requires proper compaction and drainage.</li>
          <li><strong>Helical piers or post foundations</strong> &mdash; Used in some situations where soil conditions or access constraints make traditional foundation work difficult.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every addition foundation is engineered based on soil conditions, load requirements, and the connection to the existing structure. We work with licensed structural engineers to ensure the foundation meets all code requirements and provides long-term stability.</p>

        <h2>Permits for Home Additions in Everett</h2>
        <p>All home additions in Everett and Snohomish County require building permits. The permit process includes plan review by the building department, structural engineering review, and multiple inspections during construction (foundation, framing, insulation, electrical, plumbing, and final). We prepare all permit applications, respond to plan review comments, and schedule all inspections as part of our service.</p>
        <p>Permit processing times in Snohomish County typically range from 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the complexity of the project and the current review backlog. We submit complete, detailed plans to minimize revision requests and keep the timeline moving.</p>

        <h2>Our Home Addition Process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Free Consultation</strong> &mdash; We visit your home, discuss your needs, review the existing structure, and talk through budget and timeline expectations.</li>
          <li><strong>Design &amp; Engineering</strong> &mdash; We develop architectural plans and coordinate structural engineering. You approve the design before we submit for permits.</li>
          <li><strong>Permitting</strong> &mdash; We handle all permit applications, plan review responses, and inspection scheduling.</li>
          <li><strong>Foundation</strong> &mdash; Excavation, forming, and pouring the foundation. This is followed by inspection and curing time.</li>
          <li><strong>Framing &amp; Roofing</strong> &mdash; Walls, floor, and roof framing, followed by sheathing, roofing, and weather barrier installation.</li>
          <li><strong>Rough-In</strong> &mdash; Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC rough-in, followed by inspections.</li>
          <li><strong>Insulation, Drywall &amp; Finish</strong> &mdash; Insulation, drywall, paint, flooring, trim, fixtures, and all finish work.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Walkthrough</strong> &mdash; We walk through the completed addition with you, address any items, and close out the project.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Add On vs. Move: Making the Right Decision</h2>
        <p>Consider the costs of selling and buying: real estate agent commissions (5-6% of sale price), closing costs on both transactions, moving expenses, and the difference in mortgage rate if your current rate is lower than today's market rate. For many Everett homeowners, the total cost of moving exceeds the cost of a well-planned addition, and the addition gives you exactly the space you need without compromising on location, school district, or neighborhood.</p>
