        <h2>More Than Parking &mdash; A Garage That Works for Your Life</h2>
        <p>A garage is one of the hardest-working spaces on your property. It protects your vehicles from the Pacific Northwest weather, stores tools and equipment, serves as a workshop, and in many cases can be converted into valuable living space. If your home lacks a garage, has a garage that is too small, or has a garage that could serve a better purpose, building or converting one is a smart investment.</p>
        <p>At NW General Contractor, we design and build custom garages throughout Everett and Snohomish County. Whether you need a new detached two-car garage, an attached garage addition, or a full garage-to-living-space conversion, we manage every phase of the project from design and permitting through construction and final inspection. We build structures that match your home, meet code, and serve your needs for decades.</p>

        <h2>Our Garage Construction Services</h2>
        <p>Garage projects come in many forms. Some homeowners need new construction from the ground up. Others want to improve or repurpose an existing garage. Here is what we handle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Detached Garage Construction</strong> &mdash; Custom-built detached garages in single, two-car, and three-car configurations. Designed to complement your home's architecture with matching siding, roofing, and trim details.</li>
          <li><strong>Attached Garage Additions</strong> &mdash; Adding a garage to a home that does not have one, or expanding an existing single-car garage to a two-car. Includes foundation, framing, roofing, siding, and integration with the existing structure.</li>
          <li><strong>Garage Conversions</strong> &mdash; Converting an existing garage into living space such as a bedroom, home office, family room, or rental unit. Includes insulation, drywall, flooring, electrical, HVAC, and egress windows to meet residential codes.</li>
          <li><strong>Garage Door Installation</strong> &mdash; New garage door installation and replacement. Insulated steel, wood carriage-style, and modern aluminum doors with electric openers, keypads, and smart-home connectivity.</li>
          <li><strong>Insulation &amp; Finishing</strong> &mdash; Converting an unfinished garage into a comfortable, usable space with insulation, drywall, lighting, and climate control. Ideal for workshops, home gyms, and hobby spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Electrical Wiring</strong> &mdash; Dedicated circuits for power tools, 240V outlets for welders and EV chargers, overhead lighting, and subpanel installation. All electrical work done to code by licensed electricians.</li>
          <li><strong>Concrete Slab Pouring</strong> &mdash; New garage floor slabs, slab repair, and floor coatings. We pour reinforced concrete with proper slope for drainage and can apply epoxy or polyurea coatings for a finished, easy-to-clean surface.</li>
          <li><strong>Workshop Buildouts</strong> &mdash; Custom workshop configurations with workbenches, tool storage, dust collection hookups, dedicated lighting, and heavy-duty electrical. We design the layout around how you work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Materials and Construction Methods</h2>
        <p><strong>Framing</strong> is the backbone of any garage. We use conventional stick-built framing with dimensional lumber, which gives us maximum flexibility in size, layout, and architectural details. Stick-built garages can be designed to match your home exactly &mdash; same roof pitch, same siding, same trim profiles. For homeowners on a tighter budget or faster timeline, pre-engineered truss packages speed up the framing phase while maintaining structural integrity.</p>
        <p><strong>Garage doors</strong> are the largest moving component and the most visible design element. Insulated steel doors with polyurethane core are the most popular choice in Snohomish County because they provide excellent thermal performance, resist denting, and are available in dozens of styles and colors. Wood carriage-style doors offer a premium, traditional look that works especially well on craftsman and farmhouse-style homes. Modern aluminum and glass doors suit contemporary architecture and flood the interior with natural light.</p>
        <p><strong>Insulation</strong> matters more than most homeowners realize, even if the garage is not heated. Insulated walls and ceiling reduce temperature swings, prevent condensation on tools and stored items, and dramatically reduce road noise. If you plan to eventually convert the space above the garage to living quarters or an ADU, building with insulation from the start saves significant cost compared to retrofitting later.</p>

        <h2>What Does Garage Construction Cost in Everett?</h2>
        <p>Garage costs depend on size, site conditions, level of finish, and whether the structure includes utilities. Here are the general ranges for projects in Snohomish County:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic detached 2-car garage</strong> ($25,000 &ndash; $40,000): Standard 20x24 or 24x24 footprint with concrete slab, stick-built framing, composite or matching siding, asphalt shingle roof, one garage door, and basic electrical (lights and outlets).</li>
          <li><strong>Finished and insulated garage</strong> ($40,000 &ndash; $60,000): Same structure with insulated walls and ceiling, drywall, upgraded lighting, 240V circuits, epoxy floor coating, and a higher-end garage door. Suitable for workshops and hobby spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Garage conversion to living space</strong> ($20,000 &ndash; $50,000): Converting an existing garage into a code-compliant living space including insulation, drywall, flooring, electrical upgrades, HVAC, egress windows, and potentially plumbing for a bathroom.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adding living space above a detached garage significantly increases both cost and value. A garage with a finished apartment or ADU above can cost $80,000 to $150,000 total but adds substantial rental income potential or multigenerational living flexibility. In Snohomish County's competitive housing market, an ADU above a garage is one of the highest-ROI improvements you can make.</p>

        <h2>Our Garage Construction Process</h2>
        <p>Building a garage is new construction, and we treat it with the same level of planning and professionalism as any addition or new build. Here is our process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Design &amp; Permitting</strong> &mdash; We assess your property, discuss your needs, and create a design that meets your goals while complying with setback requirements, lot coverage limits, and building codes. We prepare construction drawings and submit permit applications on your behalf.</li>
          <li><strong>Site Preparation &amp; Foundation</strong> &mdash; The site is cleared, graded, and excavated for footings. We pour reinforced concrete footings and a slab with proper drainage slope. For sites with challenging soil or slope conditions, we engineer the foundation accordingly.</li>
          <li><strong>Framing</strong> &mdash; Walls, roof trusses, and sheathing go up. The structure takes shape quickly during framing, and we schedule an inspection before closing in the walls.</li>
          <li><strong>Roofing</strong> &mdash; Roofing underlayment, flashing, and shingles or metal roofing are installed. We match the roofing material and color to your existing home for a cohesive look from the street.</li>
          <li><strong>Siding &amp; Exterior</strong> &mdash; Siding, trim, fascia, and soffits are installed to match the house. Windows, if included, are flashed and sealed for weather protection. The garage begins to look like a permanent part of the property.</li>
          <li><strong>Electrical &amp; Insulation</strong> &mdash; Wiring is run for lighting, outlets, and any 240V circuits. Insulation is installed in walls and ceiling if the garage is being finished. Everything is inspected before drywall.</li>
          <li><strong>Concrete Floor &amp; Interior</strong> &mdash; If the garage is being finished, drywall goes up, the floor is sealed or coated, and any interior buildout (workbench, storage, etc.) is completed.</li>
          <li><strong>Garage Door Installation</strong> &mdash; The garage door is hung, the opener is mounted and programmed, and hardware is tested. We set up keypads, remotes, and smart-home integration if requested.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Inspection &amp; Walkthrough</strong> &mdash; We schedule the final building inspection, walk the completed project with you, and address any remaining items before we consider the project complete.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline: How Long Does Garage Construction Take?</h2>
        <p>Garage construction timelines depend on the type and complexity of the project. Here is what to expect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Detached garage (basic): 4&ndash;6 weeks from foundation to completion</li>
          <li>Detached garage (finished with utilities): 6&ndash;8 weeks</li>
          <li>Garage with ADU above: 10&ndash;16 weeks</li>
          <li>Garage conversion to living space: 3&ndash;6 weeks</li>
          <li>Garage door replacement: 1 day</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Permit processing in Everett and Snohomish County typically adds 2 to 4 weeks before construction can begin. Material lead times for custom garage doors, windows, and specialty items should also be factored in. We build realistic schedules and communicate any changes promptly.</p>

        <h2>Permits for Garage Construction in Everett</h2>
        <p>Garage construction always requires building permits in Everett and Snohomish County. Here is what triggers permitting requirements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All new garage construction (attached or detached) requires a building permit</li>
          <li>Garage conversions to living space require permits for change of use, plus electrical, plumbing, and mechanical permits as applicable</li>
          <li>Electrical work (new circuits, subpanels, 240V outlets) requires a separate electrical permit</li>
          <li>Concrete slab work may require a grading or foundation permit depending on scope</li>
          <li>Structures exceeding lot coverage or setback limits may require a variance from the planning department</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We handle the entire permit process from initial application through final inspection. Our drawings and documentation are prepared to meet the requirements of the City of Everett and Snohomish County building departments, which helps avoid delays and revision requests.</p>
