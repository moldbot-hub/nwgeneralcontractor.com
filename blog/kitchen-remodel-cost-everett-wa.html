        <p>If you're planning a kitchen remodel in Everett, Washington, one of the first questions on your mind is probably: <strong>how much is this going to cost?</strong> It's a fair question, and the answer depends on the scope of work, the materials you choose, and the current state of your kitchen.</p>

        <p>In 2026, kitchen remodel costs in the Everett area range from around <strong>$10,000 for a basic refresh to $60,000 or more for a full custom renovation</strong>. The Puget Sound region tends to run slightly higher than national averages due to strong demand for skilled labor, higher material transport costs, and local permitting requirements.</p>

        <p>We've put together this comprehensive guide based on our experience remodeling kitchens across Snohomish County. Whether you're updating a starter home in North Everett or renovating a larger property in Silver Lake, here's what you can realistically expect to spend.</p>

        <h2>Budget Kitchen Remodel: $10,000 - $22,000</h2>

        <p>A budget kitchen remodel focuses on making the most impactful visual changes without moving plumbing, electrical, or walls. This level of renovation works well for homeowners who want to modernize an outdated kitchen without a massive investment, or for those preparing a home for sale.</p>

        <h3>What You Get at This Price Point</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cabinet refacing or painting:</strong> Instead of replacing cabinets entirely, you refinish or paint existing cabinet boxes and install new doors and hardware. This alone can transform the look of a kitchen for $3,000-$6,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Laminate or butcher block countertops:</strong> Modern laminate countertops have come a long way and can mimic the look of stone for a fraction of the cost. Expect to pay $1,500-$3,000 for new countertops at this level.</li>
          <li><strong>New flooring:</strong> Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) is the go-to choice for budget remodels. It's waterproof, durable, and looks great. Budget $1,200-$2,500 for materials and installation.</li>
          <li><strong>Updated fixtures and hardware:</strong> New faucet, cabinet pulls, and light fixtures can make a surprising difference. Plan for $500-$1,500.</li>
          <li><strong>Fresh paint and backsplash:</strong> A subway tile backsplash and fresh paint on the walls round out the refresh. $800-$2,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Basic appliance upgrades:</strong> If your current appliances are functional but dated, this budget may allow for one or two new mid-range appliances.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A budget remodel keeps the existing kitchen layout intact. You're working with the current footprint, which means no permits needed for most of the work (unless you're changing electrical or plumbing connections).</p>

        <h2>Mid-Range Kitchen Remodel: $22,000 - $40,000</h2>

        <p>This is the sweet spot for most Everett homeowners. A mid-range remodel gives you the best balance of quality, aesthetics, and return on investment. You're getting real upgrades that will last 15-20 years and significantly improve your daily experience in the kitchen.</p>

        <h3>What You Get at This Price Point</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Semi-custom or new stock cabinets:</strong> Full replacement of cabinets with semi-custom options from brands like KraftMaid or Diamond. Soft-close hinges, pull-out drawers, and better storage solutions. $8,000-$14,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Quartz or granite countertops:</strong> Quartz has become the most popular countertop choice in our area. It's durable, low-maintenance, and available in hundreds of colors and patterns. $3,500-$6,000 installed.</li>
          <li><strong>Tile or hardwood flooring:</strong> Porcelain tile or engineered hardwood that matches the rest of the home. $2,500-$4,500.</li>
          <li><strong>New appliance package:</strong> A matching stainless steel suite including range, refrigerator, dishwasher, and microwave from a brand like Samsung, LG, or KitchenAid. $3,000-$6,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Updated plumbing and electrical:</strong> New under-cabinet lighting, additional outlets, and possibly relocating a sink or dishwasher. $2,000-$4,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Tile backsplash:</strong> A designer tile backsplash adds personality and protects walls. $1,000-$2,500.</li>
          <li><strong>Minor layout changes:</strong> Removing a small non-load-bearing wall or adding an island is possible at this budget. Structural changes add cost but can dramatically improve flow.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At the mid-range level, you'll likely need permits from the City of Everett for plumbing and electrical work. Your contractor should handle the permitting process, which typically adds 2-4 weeks to the project timeline.</p>

        <h2>High-End Kitchen Remodel: $40,000 - $60,000+</h2>

        <p>A high-end kitchen remodel is a full transformation. Everything is selected for quality, durability, and design. This level of renovation is common in neighborhoods like Mukilteo, Mill Creek, and the nicer areas of South Everett where home values support the investment.</p>

        <h3>What You Get at This Price Point</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Custom cabinetry:</strong> Built to your exact specifications with premium materials like maple, cherry, or walnut. Features include integrated organizers, glass-front doors, and custom finishes. $15,000-$25,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Premium countertops:</strong> High-end quartz, natural marble, quartzite, or even concrete countertops with waterfall edges. $5,000-$10,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional-grade appliances:</strong> Brands like Sub-Zero, Wolf, Thermador, or Miele. A professional range alone can run $4,000-$10,000. Full suite: $8,000-$18,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Custom tile work:</strong> Hand-laid mosaic backsplashes, heated tile floors, and designer patterns. $3,000-$6,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Layout reconfiguration:</strong> Moving walls, relocating plumbing and gas lines, adding windows, or opening up to an adjacent room. Structural engineering may be required. $5,000-$12,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Premium lighting design:</strong> Layered lighting plan with recessed fixtures, pendant lights, under-cabinet LEDs, and dimmer controls. $2,000-$4,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Custom details:</strong> Built-in wine storage, pot filler faucet, integrated charging stations, touchless faucets, and custom range hoods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cost Breakdown by Component</h2>

        <p>Regardless of your total budget, the percentage breakdown tends to stay fairly consistent. Understanding where your money goes helps you make smarter allocation decisions:</p>

        <table class="cost-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Component</th>
              <th>% of Budget</th>
              <th>$30K Remodel</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Cabinets &amp; Hardware</td><td>30-35%</td><td>$9,000 - $10,500</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Labor &amp; Installation</td><td>20-25%</td><td>$6,000 - $7,500</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Appliances</td><td>15-20%</td><td>$4,500 - $6,000</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Countertops</td><td>10-15%</td><td>$3,000 - $4,500</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Flooring</td><td>7-10%</td><td>$2,100 - $3,000</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Lighting &amp; Electrical</td><td>5-7%</td><td>$1,500 - $2,100</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Plumbing</td><td>4-6%</td><td>$1,200 - $1,800</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Backsplash &amp; Paint</td><td>3-5%</td><td>$900 - $1,500</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Cabinets consistently take the biggest chunk. If you're looking to cut costs without sacrificing the overall feel, refacing or painting existing cabinets is the single most effective move.</p>

        <h2>Factors That Affect Cost in the Everett Area</h2>

        <p>Kitchen remodel costs aren't the same everywhere. Several factors specific to Everett and Snohomish County affect what you'll pay:</p>

        <h3>Local Labor Rates</h3>
        <p>Skilled trades in the Puget Sound region command higher wages than the national average. The Seattle metro area's construction boom over the past decade has kept demand for qualified tradespeople high. Expect labor rates of $50-$85 per hour for experienced installers, plumbers, and electricians in the Everett area.</p>

        <h3>Permit Costs</h3>
        <p>Building permits in the City of Everett are based on the project's value. For a kitchen remodel, expect to pay <strong>$500-$1,500 in permit fees</strong> depending on the scope of work. Unincorporated Snohomish County has its own fee schedule. Permit review times typically run 2-4 weeks, so factor that into your project timeline.</p>

        <h3>Material Availability and Shipping</h3>
        <p>While the Pacific Northwest has good access to building materials, specialty items like imported tile or custom cabinetry may have longer lead times. Local suppliers like Lowe's, Home Depot, and specialty showrooms in Everett and Lynnwood stock most standard materials, but custom orders can take 4-8 weeks.</p>

        <h3>Age of Home</h3>
        <p>Everett has a mix of older craftsman homes (built 1900-1940s) and newer construction. Older homes often have surprises behind the walls: outdated wiring, galvanized plumbing, or inadequate support structures. Budget an extra 10-15% contingency if your home was built before 1970.</p>

        <h3>Seasonal Timing</h3>
        <p>The construction season in the Pacific Northwest peaks from April through October. Scheduling your remodel during the slower winter months (November-March) may get you better availability and occasionally better pricing from contractors.</p>

        <h2>Return on Investment</h2>

        <p>A kitchen remodel is one of the best investments you can make in your home. According to the <strong>Cost vs. Value Report</strong>, a major kitchen remodel in the Pacific region recoups approximately <strong>77.6% of the investment</strong> at resale. Minor kitchen remodels perform even better, often recouping 85% or more.</p>

        <p>Beyond resale value, a remodeled kitchen improves your daily quality of life and can make your home easier to sell when the time comes. In the competitive Snohomish County real estate market, an updated kitchen is often the deciding factor for buyers.</p>

        <h2>Tips to Save Money Without Sacrificing Quality</h2>

        <p>After years of remodeling kitchens across Everett and Snohomish County, here are our top recommendations for getting the most value from your budget:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Keep the existing layout:</strong> Moving plumbing and gas lines is expensive. If your current layout works reasonably well, invest in better materials instead of relocating fixtures.</li>
          <li><strong>Refinish instead of replace cabinets:</strong> If your cabinet boxes are structurally sound, painting or refacing them saves $5,000-$10,000 compared to full replacement.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose quartz over natural stone:</strong> Quartz countertops are more durable, require zero maintenance, and cost less than premium granite or marble.</li>
          <li><strong>Skip the appliance upgrades if yours are recent:</strong> If your appliances are less than 5-7 years old and working well, put that money into cabinets or countertops instead.</li>
          <li><strong>Do some demo yourself:</strong> Removing old cabinets, flooring, or backsplash yourself can save $500-$1,500 in labor. Just don't touch plumbing, electrical, or structural elements.</li>
          <li><strong>Buy appliances during sales events:</strong> Major holidays (Memorial Day, Labor Day, Black Friday) bring significant appliance discounts. Plan ahead and buy during sales.</li>
          <li><strong>Work with a general contractor:</strong> A good GC manages subcontractors, materials, and scheduling. Their markup is offset by trade discounts on materials and avoiding costly mistakes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline Expectations</h2>

        <p>Understanding the timeline helps you plan for disruption. Here's what to expect at each level:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Budget remodel (cosmetic):</strong> 3-5 weeks from start to finish. Minimal disruption.</li>
          <li><strong>Mid-range remodel:</strong> 6-10 weeks including permit processing. Plan to be without a functional kitchen for 3-6 weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>High-end remodel:</strong> 10-16 weeks or more. Custom materials have longer lead times, and structural work adds complexity. Plan for 6-10 weeks without a kitchen.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In all cases, add 2-4 weeks at the front end for design, material selection, and permit processing through the City of Everett or Snohomish County.</p>
