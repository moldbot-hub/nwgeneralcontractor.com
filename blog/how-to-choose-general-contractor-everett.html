        <p>Hiring a general contractor is one of the most important decisions you'll make during any home improvement project. The right contractor delivers quality work on time and on budget. The wrong one can cost you thousands in delays, poor workmanship, and stress. In the Everett area, where home values continue to climb and the construction market is competitive, knowing how to vet a contractor properly is essential.</p>

        <p>This guide walks you through every step of the process, from verifying licenses to spotting red flags, so you can make a confident decision.</p>

        <h2>1. Verify Washington State Contractor Registration</h2>

        <p>This is the single most important step, and it takes about 30 seconds. <strong>Every general contractor in Washington state must be registered with the Department of Labor &amp; Industries (L&amp;I).</strong> Operating without registration is illegal, and hiring an unregistered contractor strips you of most legal protections if something goes wrong.</p>

        <p>To verify a contractor's registration:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Visit <a href="https://lni.wa.gov/verify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lni.wa.gov/verify</a></li>
          <li>Enter the contractor's business name or UBI (Unified Business Identifier) number</li>
          <li>Review their registration status, specialty, and any infractions</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The L&amp;I lookup will show you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whether the registration is active and current</li>
          <li>The contractor's specialty (general, electrical, plumbing, etc.)</li>
          <li>Bond information and status</li>
          <li>Insurance verification</li>
          <li>Any complaints, violations, or infractions on file</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If a contractor can't provide a registration number or doesn't appear in the L&amp;I database, stop the conversation there. No exceptions.</p>

        <h2>2. Confirm the $30,000 Surety Bond and Liability Insurance</h2>

        <p>Washington state requires all registered contractors to carry a <strong>$30,000 surety bond</strong>. This bond protects you, the homeowner, if the contractor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fails to complete the work as agreed</li>
          <li>Doesn't pay subcontractors or material suppliers (who could then lien your property)</li>
          <li>Causes property damage</li>
          <li>Violates the contract terms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In addition to the bond, a reputable contractor should carry <strong>general liability insurance</strong> (typically $1 million or more) and <strong>workers' compensation insurance</strong> for their employees. Ask for a Certificate of Insurance (COI) and verify it's current. If a contractor's worker is injured on your property and they don't have workers' comp, you could be liable.</p>

        <p>Both the bond and insurance status are verifiable through the L&amp;I website. If anything has lapsed, that's a red flag.</p>

        <h2>3. Read Online Reviews Carefully</h2>

        <p>Online reviews provide insight into a contractor's reliability, quality of work, communication style, and how they handle problems. Check multiple platforms for a well-rounded picture:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google Business Profile:</strong> The most widely used review platform. Look at both the overall rating and read individual reviews, especially recent ones. Pay attention to how the contractor responds to negative reviews — professionalism matters.</li>
          <li><strong>Yelp:</strong> Tends to have more detailed reviews. Filter for "Contractors" in the Everett area.</li>
          <li><strong>Better Business Bureau (BBB):</strong> Check for the contractor's BBB rating and any filed complaints. An "A+" rating with zero complaints is ideal, but also look at how complaints were resolved.</li>
          <li><strong>Nextdoor and local Facebook groups:</strong> Community recommendations from your actual neighbors carry significant weight.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What to look for in reviews:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistency of positive feedback across platforms</li>
          <li>Specific mentions of completed projects similar to yours</li>
          <li>Comments about communication and responsiveness</li>
          <li>How the contractor handled unexpected issues or change orders</li>
          <li>Whether projects were completed on time and on budget</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Be cautious of contractors with no online presence at all. In 2026, a legitimate, established contractor should have reviews.</p>

        <h2>4. Get at Least 3 Written Estimates</h2>

        <p>Getting multiple estimates isn't just about finding the lowest price — it's about understanding the range of approaches and costs for your project. Three estimates is the minimum; the more complex your project, the more valuable additional perspectives become.</p>

        <h3>What a Good Estimate Should Include</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Detailed scope of work:</strong> Specific descriptions of what will be done, not vague summaries</li>
          <li><strong>Material specifications:</strong> Brands, models, quantities, and quality levels for all major materials</li>
          <li><strong>Labor costs:</strong> Broken out separately from materials where possible</li>
          <li><strong>Permit fees:</strong> Listed as a line item</li>
          <li><strong>Project timeline:</strong> Start date, milestones, and expected completion date</li>
          <li><strong>Payment schedule:</strong> When payments are due and what triggers each payment</li>
          <li><strong>Warranty information:</strong> What's covered and for how long</li>
          <li><strong>Change order process:</strong> How additional work or changes will be priced and approved</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If an estimate is just a single number on a piece of paper, that's not a real estimate — it's a guess. Detailed estimates protect both you and the contractor by setting clear expectations.</p>

        <p><strong>Be wary of the lowest bid.</strong> If one estimate is significantly lower than the others (25%+ below the average), there's usually a reason: they're cutting corners on materials, underestimating the scope, using unlicensed subcontractors, or planning to hit you with change orders later.</p>

        <h2>5. Ask for References and Recent Project Photos</h2>

        <p>Any contractor worth hiring should be proud to share their work. Ask for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>3-5 references from recent projects</strong> (within the last 12 months). Actually call them. Ask about the quality of work, communication, timeline accuracy, and whether they'd hire the contractor again.</li>
          <li><strong>Photos of completed projects</strong> similar to what you're planning. A kitchen remodeler should be able to show you finished kitchens. An ADU builder should have ADU photos.</li>
          <li><strong>An active project you can visit</strong> (with the homeowner's permission). Seeing a jobsite in progress tells you a lot about how a contractor operates — cleanliness, organization, crew professionalism, and quality of in-progress work.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Questions to ask references:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Was the project completed on time and on budget?</li>
          <li>How did the contractor handle unexpected issues?</li>
          <li>Was communication consistent throughout the project?</li>
          <li>Were there any surprises with the final cost?</li>
          <li>Would you hire this contractor again?</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>6. Understand the Contract Before Signing</h2>

        <p>A solid contract protects everyone. Before signing, make sure the contract clearly addresses these elements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scope of work:</strong> Everything that will be done, described in detail. If it's not in the contract, don't assume it's included.</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Start date, completion date, and consequences for significant delays (excluding weather and material delays beyond the contractor's control).</li>
          <li><strong>Payment schedule:</strong> Tied to milestones, not arbitrary dates. A typical schedule might be 10% deposit, 30% at demolition completion, 30% at rough-in completion, and 30% at final completion. Never pay more than 10-15% upfront.</li>
          <li><strong>Change order process:</strong> How changes to the scope will be documented, priced, and approved. Every change should be in writing before work begins.</li>
          <li><strong>Materials specifications:</strong> Exact products, not "or equivalent." If specific materials are important to you, they need to be in the contract.</li>
          <li><strong>Warranty:</strong> What the contractor warrants, for how long, and how warranty claims are handled. Washington state provides a 6-year statute of repose for construction defects, but contractor warranties often cover workmanship for 1-2 years.</li>
          <li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> How disagreements will be handled (mediation, arbitration, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Permit responsibility:</strong> Who pulls the permits and pays for them. This should be the contractor.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Take the time to read the contract thoroughly. Ask questions about anything you don't understand. A good contractor welcomes questions about their contract — they want you to feel comfortable and informed.</p>

        <h2>7. Red Flags to Watch For</h2>

        <p>After years in the industry, these are the warning signs that should make you walk away:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>No contractor registration:</strong> Illegal in Washington state. Full stop.</li>
          <li><strong>Cash-only payment:</strong> Legitimate contractors accept checks and often credit cards. Cash-only requests are a tax evasion signal and leave you with no payment trail.</li>
          <li><strong>No written contract:</strong> A handshake deal offers you zero legal protection.</li>
          <li><strong>Full payment upfront:</strong> No legitimate contractor asks for more than 10-15% as a deposit. Demanding full payment before work begins is a classic scam.</li>
          <li><strong>Pressure to sign immediately:</strong> "This price is only good today" is a high-pressure sales tactic. A fair estimate should be valid for at least 30 days.</li>
          <li><strong>No physical business address:</strong> A P.O. Box only or no address at all makes it difficult to pursue the contractor if problems arise.</li>
          <li><strong>Unwilling to provide references:</strong> Every established contractor has satisfied customers. If they won't share references, there's a reason.</li>
          <li><strong>Can't show proof of insurance:</strong> A legitimate contractor can produce a Certificate of Insurance within 24 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Door-to-door solicitation after a storm:</strong> Storm chasers who show up uninvited after weather events are notorious for poor work and insurance fraud.</li>
          <li><strong>Drastically lower bid than competitors:</strong> An estimate that's 30-40% below others is likely missing something or setting you up for change orders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Questions to Ask During the Estimate Visit</h2>

        <p>When a contractor comes to your home for an estimate, use the visit to evaluate both their expertise and professionalism. Good questions to ask:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>How long have you been in business, and how long have you worked in the Everett/Snohomish County area?</li>
          <li>Who will be the day-to-day project manager on my job?</li>
          <li>Do you use your own crew or subcontractors? Are the subcontractors also licensed and insured?</li>
          <li>How do you handle communication and updates during the project?</li>
          <li>What's your approach to keeping the worksite clean and respecting my home?</li>
          <li>Have you done projects similar to mine? Can you show me examples?</li>
          <li>How do you handle issues that come up mid-project?</li>
          <li>What's your current workload and when could you start?</li>
          <li>What warranties do you offer on your work?</li>
          <li>Will you handle all permitting?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Pay attention to how the contractor conducts the estimate visit. Do they arrive on time? Do they take measurements and notes? Do they ask you questions about your goals and preferences? A contractor who's thorough during the estimate is likely to be thorough during the project.</p>

        <h2>9. Why Local Matters</h2>

        <p>When choosing a contractor in Everett, there are real advantages to working with a local company:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Familiarity with local codes:</strong> Everett, Snohomish County, and other local jurisdictions each have their own permitting processes and code interpretations. A local contractor knows these systems and has working relationships with building departments.</li>
          <li><strong>Established subcontractor relationships:</strong> Local contractors have vetted teams of plumbers, electricians, and other specialists who know the area and deliver consistent quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> A local contractor lives and works in your community. Their reputation is their livelihood. They can't just move on to the next city if a project goes sideways.</li>
          <li><strong>Material sourcing:</strong> Local contractors know the best suppliers in the area and can often get better pricing and faster delivery on materials.</li>
          <li><strong>Warranty service:</strong> If something needs attention after the project is complete, a local contractor can respond quickly. A contractor based two hours away is far less likely to make a timely warranty visit.</li>
          <li><strong>Community investment:</strong> When you hire local, your money stays in the local economy. You're supporting your neighbors and community.</li>
        </ul>
